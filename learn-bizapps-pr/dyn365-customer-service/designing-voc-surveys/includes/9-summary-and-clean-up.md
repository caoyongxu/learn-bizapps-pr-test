The opinions and overall satisfaction of customers play a huge role in the health of an organization. It's important to have a successful engagement strategy, so that you can identify potential shortcomings and implement corrective action as soon as possible. The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Voice of the Customer solution makes it easy for organizations to develop and deploy survey solutions that capture valuable feedback and help guarantee that customer needs are being met.

We looked at several of the key components that Voice of the Customer provides. For example, you learned:

- How to deploy Voice of the Customer to a Dynamics 365 environment so that you can capture customer feedback through surveys.
- How to add survey collateral like themes and images, to provide a branded experience to your customers.
- How to create surveys by using Voice of the Customer. For example, you learned about the different pages that are used, how to define survey pages and sections, and how to control survey actions by doing things like providing an unsubscribe link.
- How to add survey parts like questions, and how to use the question editor to take advantage of additional setup options for questions.
- The procedure for publishing and distributing surveys to respondents, including previewing and testing capabilities.

The next steps are to learn more about the personalization and interaction options that are available in Voice of the Customer. For example, you can learn how to work with piped data, design interactive surveys that include response routing and answer tags, and set up survey scoring options.
