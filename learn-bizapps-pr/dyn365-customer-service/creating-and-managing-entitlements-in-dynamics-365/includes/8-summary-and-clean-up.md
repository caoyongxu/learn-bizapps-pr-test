Dynamics 365's entitlement feature provides a great mechanism for organizations to manage support or maintenance contracts for their customers. They can ensure that customers are able to submit cases associated with their entitlements using the best and most appropriate channels for them. They can also ensure that only people with the
appropriate credentials can submit cases.

We looked several of the key components that Dynamics 365 entitlement use to provide the right service for their customers including:

-   How to create entitlement records in Dynamics 365 including defining service periods, the type of contract it is, and the total terms for the record.
-   Examining how entitlement channels can be leveraged to control which specific channels (email, phone, social media, etc.) can be used to open cases against the entitlement, as well as specific cases where limiting channels would benefit an organization.
-   Explaining how products and contacts can be associated with entitlements to ensure that only cases that include those products (or have been submitted by specific individuals) can be opened against a specific entitlement.
-   How Entitlement Templates can be created and leveraged to save the organization time when creating individual entitlement records for customers.

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding of Dynamics 365's Service Level Agreement (SLA) feature. SLA's can be leveraged in conjunction with entitlements to help organizations define and meet specific Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) that are important to them.
