Dynamics 365's Service Level Agreement feature, allows organizations to clearly define and deliver a specific level of service to their customers based on predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPI's). Service Level Agreements can evaluate specific details on a record and apply and assist in the enforcement of the correct KPI's for that case.

We looked at several of the key components included with Dynamics 365's Service Level Agreement functionality including:

-   How organizations can define different service calendars and business closures that can be associated with specific SLA's to ensure that customers are receiving the right level of service regardless of time and location.

-   Exploring the process of creating and defining SLA's in Dynamics 365.

-   Examining how SLA Detail Items are used to define which specific KPI should be applied to records based on predefined criteria in the record.

-   How other record types in Dynamics 365 can be enabled for use with SLA's, and the process for defining additional or custom KPIs to support different business scenarios.

-   Exploring options for managing SLA's including their relationship with entitlements, working with timers, and defining default SLA's for an organization.

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding of Dynamics 365's Entitlements. While Service Level Agreements are great for defining and enforcing KPI's, entitlements can be leveraged to manage the number of cases that a customer can open as well as which channels are available to them.
