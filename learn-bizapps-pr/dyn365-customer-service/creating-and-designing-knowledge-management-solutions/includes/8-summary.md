Organizations who have a clearly defined knowledge management solution are in a much better position to ensure that both customers and internal employees have the necessary information at their disposal to address problem and concerns.  By creating knowledge articles and defining a clear knowledge management lifecycle, organizations can ensure that the content available is accurate and relevant to those who need to consume it.   
     
We looked at how Dynamics 365â€™s Knowledge Management solution provides a total solution for managing an organization knowledge repository including:

- Examining the process used to create knowledge articles, and how to leverage the design editor to develop rich and engaging article content.    
- How organizations can manage an article throughout its entire life cycle from creation, to article review and approval, and to publishing articles to make them available to the masses.  
- How leverage versioning to track an articles changes over its entire life and develop multiple versions in several different languages to support customers across all the regions an organization supports.  
- Reviewing the article publication process and more specific options, such as when and if articles should no longer be valid, as well as what to do with them at the end of their life span.  

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding of how Dynamics 365 Knowledge Articles are leveraged to provide support agents the ability to search and leverage them from different Dynamics 365 records.
