As you've seen, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Service helps organizations better serve their customers and manage agent caseloads by providing a wide range of case management options. Whether agents are looking for more efficient ways to create cases or better ways to manage the case lifecycle, the case management tools in Microsoft Dynamics 365 can help them throughout the management process.

In this module, we looked at several key components that Dynamics 365 provides for case management, including:

- The different case creation options that are available to organizations. For example, agents might manually create cases, or activity records like emails or phone calls might be converted to case records.
- How organizations can take advantage of the automatic record creation and update rules in Dynamics 365 to automatically create cases from records like emails or social activities.
- How you can use the Dynamics 365 unified interface to easily identify and manage caseloads. For example, you can use items like interactive dashboards to filter and organize data, or you can use business process flows and supporting activities to guide agents through the case resolution lifecycle.
- How Dynamics 365 case hierarchies and merging functionality can make it easier for organizations to manage duplicate and related cases.
- Where status reasons are used in the case management process, and how an organization can define custom transition paths to help guarantee that agents don't select reasons that don't apply to the current state of the case.

From here, the next steps are to learn more about how you can use Dynamics 365 queues in conjunction with cases to more efficiently route cases to the most appropriate person, for better management of agent caseloads.
