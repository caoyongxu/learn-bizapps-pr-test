As you've seen, the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Voice of the Customer solution has several options for distributing surveys to customers, and for automating and personalizing the distribution. Additionally, it has tools that make it easier to create and deploy surveys, add translation options, and analyze survey data.

We looked at several options that Voice of the Customer provides to deliver this functionality. For example, you learned:

- The different options that are available for distributing surveys to both anonymous and non-anonymous respondents.
- How to personalize the survey invitation that respondents receive, and how to include personalized data in the survey.
- How to automate and trigger survey distribution based on specific Dynamics 365 events, like when a case is resolved in the system.
- How you can use features like survey cloning and section or survey import to simplify the process of creating surveys.
- How to add additional language translations to surveys.
- The different analytical and reporting offerings that are available in the solution.
- How items like Dynamics 365 leads and emails can be triggered for different surveys.

The next steps are to learn more about the personalization and interaction options that are available in Voice of the Customer. For example, you can learn how to work with piped data, design interactive surveys that include response routing and answer tags, and set up survey scoring options.
