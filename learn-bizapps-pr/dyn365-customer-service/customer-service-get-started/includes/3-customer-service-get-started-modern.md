## Modern customer journey

Service has changed drastically over the past five to ten years. In the past, a customer would call in and be put on hold until somebody picked up the phone to help. Today, the support landscape has changed. 

Today’s customer starts a support journey from multiple starting points.

Now with the advent of self-service capabilities, customers can begin to educate themselves using any of the following:

- Portals with an interactive bot
- Live assisted chat windows
- Interactive kiosks
- A mobile app deployed by a customer's organization
- Screens being shared remotely between a service agent and the customer
- Any number of social networks including Facebook and Twitter

This tells us that we can never be certain just where the customer is coming from, but we do need to be prepared with all possible channels and media open and listening.

## Customer perspective and expections
It is also not enough just to have a bunch of different channels. Your service organization must be integrated so that:

- All the support channels have the same information. You don't want your bots giving advice that differs from what a customer representative would give.
- Your support channels need to be seamlessly connected so that information can easily pass from one to the other.

And the complexity doesn't stop here. In general, the modern service company must consider the following:

- **Social media**: Customers are highly active on social media. And dont' expect them to comment on just the things they like. They'll report on what they don't like. And loudly. Worse, many of their friends—and potential customers—are listening, too, and forming their own opinions of your company.
- **Company size**: Company's often want to target both small and enterprise customers through the same channels.
- **Support for contract and non-contract customers**: Everyone gets support, not just those with service-level agreements. Again, you don't know where new customers are coming from.
- **Fast response times**: Customers expect fast response times. If you can't give them a timely response, they'll go elsewhere, including to your competitors who might have a better support channel in place.
- **On-site support**: If the customer can't be helped online, the customer often expects the service company to visit the customer at their place of business or in the field to resolve an issue. 

## Typical customer journey
The typical customer will follow a particular path to get a resolution to their problem:

1. **Self-assisted**: When people need help, the first thing they do is hop onto the internet and see if they can fix it themselves. They'll visit a few forums and newsgroups and ask a few questions hoping for a quick fix. They might visit the company's website do some research while rooting around in the documentation.
1. **Initial case creation and routing**: Cases will get generated from multiple channels. From here, they could be routed to specific queues bases on factors such as whether there is a contract, or if they are preferred customers, or whether there is a  technician available on a queue that is qualified to handle a specific problem.
1. **Case management and Resolution**: A service agent will now track all communication with the customer, and follow a dedicated case resolution process while leveraging an internal knowledge base. At this point, customer communication could be through email, text message, phone call, or email. Cases are typically tracked to create an historical log of what happened with the customer. Knowledge bases will be built out as well so that other service representatives will leverage knowledge from past cases.
1. **Post-case**: What happens after the case is resolved is becoming a critical part of what a customer service organization does. Companies now want get feedback from customers on the quality of the interaction in order to keep channels open and to encourage the customer to stay with the company. A survey might be presented with specifics of the case to glean more insight from the case to further build out the knowledge base.

This is typically how a customer interracts with a support company in the modern world.
