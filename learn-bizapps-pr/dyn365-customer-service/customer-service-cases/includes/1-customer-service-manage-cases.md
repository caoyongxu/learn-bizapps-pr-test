## Manage case workload
By understanding how your organization measures success, you gain insight into core priorities and drivers. Only then can you understand what data modeling, security requirements, and customization must be done.

Although every organization focuses on different items as part of its practice, here are some of the more common key performance indicators (KPIs) for customer service:

- **First Contact Resolution (FCR)**: FCR tracks how often an organization correctly addresses customer needs the first time a customer calls, so that the customer doesn't have to follow up with a second call.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: NPS is a management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of an organization's customers.
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and Customer Effort Score**: These scores describe many types of customer service survey questions. The goal of any CSAT score is to measure a customer's satisfaction level with a company's product. Customer Effort Score measures how much time and effort the customer spent getting an issue resolved. Customers aren't usually happy if they spend too much time resolving an issue. Customer Effort Score is a strong indicator of future customer loyalty.
- **Cost per Contact**: Cost per Contact is a call center metric that's calculated by dividing the total operational costs by the total number of calls for a given period (or the average, broken out by channels).
- **Wait Time and Backlog metrics**: Wait Time indicates the average time that customers spend on hold as they wait for an agent to take their call. Backlog metrics track the number of open cases or tickets for any period.
- **Average Handle Time**: Average Handle Time indicates the average duration of one transaction. Duration is typically measured from the customer's initiation of the call, and includes any hold time, talk time, and related tasks that follow the transaction.

### Case management
*Cases* are the fundamental record type in service management. Each case represents a single incident of service. Organizations might use different terms to refer to cases: incidents, tickets, service requests, and so on. Many cases can be associated with a single customer record at the same time. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Service, users can see open and resolved cases from the customer record.

Knowledge Base articles, subjects, products, and entitlements can be associated with cases as related or dependent record types. In addition, activity record types, sometimes referred to as *activities*, can be associated with cases. That way, everyone in the organization can see what's happening with a case. Examples of activities include communication records.

### Creating case records
Activities can be used to manage and report on interactions with customers and potential customers, like accounts, contacts, and leads. Activities can also be associated with most other record types in Customer Service, including cases.

Here are some examples of activities:

- E-mails
- Phone calls
- Appointments
- Faxes
- Service activities
- Campaign responses
- Letters

In addition, users who have the correct security privileges can create custom activity types. 

Sometimes, an activity already contains the information that's required to create a case. In these cases, it's easier to convert that information into a case than to create a new case and re-enter the information.
