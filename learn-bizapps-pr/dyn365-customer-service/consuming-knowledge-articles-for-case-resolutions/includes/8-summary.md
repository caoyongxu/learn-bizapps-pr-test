Knowledge articles are most effective for the people who consume them if they can easily be used in the context where they're needed. It's much easier for agents to find the best articles to resolve customer issues if they can use relevant information in the case that they're working on to search for articles. Microsoft Dynamics 365 gives organizations several ways to define when and where article information should be available to agents.

We looked at many of the components that Dynamics 365 provides for using knowledge articles to resolve issues. Here are some of the things that you learned:

- How to configure the knowledge base and define which entities in an organization should be able to take advantage of articles.
- The process of adding and configuring the **Knowledge Base Search** control for specific entities. This process includes defining what data is used to search for content and how to make sure that the appropriate translated version is available to agents.
- How agents or representatives can interact with articles. These interactions include searching for content, linking articles to records, and emailing article content to customers.
- The different analytical options that are available for articles, and how the analytics can be used to create and deploy better content over time.

The next steps are to learn more about how Dynamics 365 can be used to define and manage service key performance indicators (KPIs) for organizations, and how to use maintenance contracts for customers.
