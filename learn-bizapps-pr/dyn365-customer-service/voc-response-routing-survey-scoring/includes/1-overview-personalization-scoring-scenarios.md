Successful engagement with your customers is more than just sending out surveys to capture their feedback. It is about ensuring that you are engaging and capturing that data in a personal and relevant manner. Consider this, when a customer determines that a survey they are taking does not pertain to them, they will likely abandon it. That does not sound like that big of a deal initially, but what if 40% of respondents that start a survey do not finish it? Are you truly getting relevant data for your entire customer base that your organization can use to move forward?

There are lots of reasons that people do not take surveys sent to them or choose to abandon them while they are taking them. Why do people abandon surveys?

-   **Survey length:** Many surveys sent to customer are just too long.
   If it takes customers more than a few minutes to complete a survey, they will likely get frustrated and move on. The trick is trying to pack as much punch as possible into a survey while still minimizing the amount of time it takes to complete.

-   **Not perceived as relevant:** Many customers don't see the survey as having any value to them
   There is a big different between "Your feedback is important to us." and "We value your feedback from your loss of internet service call on September 1st". The second specifically shows relevance.

-   **Hard or confusing to navigate:** Many surveys will have a standard set of questions that may or may not apply to all the respondents taking the survey.
   What If we could target and limit the questions asked based on actual information provided by the respondent as they take it?

There could be countless other reason why customer could exit a survey early. The trick is to design surveys that limit the opportunities to leave early.

What about those customers that do complete the survey? How can we extract the relevant data from that response and turn it into a tangible and targeted business action?

For example, let's say a respondent is completing a customer satisfaction survey they received after a recent support call that did not go well. Organizations are going to want to engage with that customer as soon as possible to try and rebuild the relationship. Could the organization use a survey scoring system to notify a team member when a customer receives a low satisfaction score?

Another example could be that when the respondent completed the survey they indicated that they were interested in some specific products. How can organizations indicate potential interest and generate a lead that is sent to the right person?

Dynamics 365's Voice of the Customer solution not only contains several features that provide organizations the ability to create and distribute surveys to their customers, but it provides several mechanisms that can be leveraged to assist with previously mentioned examples.

Some of the key components that can be leveraged are:

-   **Survey personalization with piped data:** Piped data allows organizations to insert data from Dynamics 365 into survey components to provide a much more personal experience.

    -   For example, if we are sending a survey to Joan to follow up with a recent case she had worked on by Jim, we can insert relevant information from that case such as the date, Joan's name, or the product that was being worked on. This will not only make for a more personal experience but can help if it has been a few weeks since Joan received the survey request.

-   **Create interactive surveys with answer tags:** Answer tags let you insert dynamic text captured in a previous questions response into subsequent questions and answers.

    -   For example, if you asked a customer if they prefer coffee or tea, and they select tea. You can use the response to personalize the remaining questions. How much tea do you consume in a day? Are you happy with your current brand of tea?

-   **Create interactive surveys with response routing:** Response routing lets you dynamically react to respondents as they take a survey.

    -   For example, if you asked a customer to identify which products they were interested in and they selected T.V.s and phones, you could send them to a series of questions that specifically focus on T.V.s and phones. What size of T.V. do you prefer? What is your current brand of phone?

    -   You could also leverage them to initiate actions based on responses, so if someone answered yes to "Are you interested in more information?" a lead could be automatically created.

-   **Initiate action with survey scoring:** Scoring models can be created for questions and surveys. If a respondent's responses fall below a specific threshold, a task is generated inside Dynamics 365.
