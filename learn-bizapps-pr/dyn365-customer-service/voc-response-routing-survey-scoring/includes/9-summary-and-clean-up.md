Successful engagement with your customers involves more than just sending out surveys. You need to make sure that your surveys are engaging, and that they deliver a personalized and relevant experience to respondents. The many personalization and interaction options that are available with Voice of the Customer help organizations achieve this goal. You can do something as simple as include the respondent's name in some of the questions. Or you can do something more complex, like tailor questions to the responses that are provided for previous questions, and trigger appropriate actions based on those responses.

We've looked at several of the key components that Voice of the Customer provides. Here's what you learned:

- How to use piped data in surveys to insert personalized information, like the respondent's name or the name of the agent who helped the respondent.
- How to define the personalized data that's included in survey invitations that are sent to customers.
- How answer tags can be used to deliver a tailored survey experience by filling in question text with answers that the respondent provided in earlier questions.
- How question and survey scoring can be used to run specific actions in Microsoft Dynamics 365 when scores fall below a predefined threshold.
- How response routing can be used to vary the survey experience that respondents have, depending on the answers that they provide, and how specific results can drive notification actions.

The next steps are to learn more about the different options that Voice of the Customer provides for analytics, driving actions, and streamlining the survey creation process.
