title: Use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Customer Service queues to manage case workloads
summary: |
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)]

  Customer support centers often use queues to manage the routing of cases that come in, so that they are handled in an organized and timely manner.         
abstract: | 
    Let's take a look at the following:
    - Identify the different types of Microsoft Dynamics 365 queues that are available
    - Create a queue, and define queue members
    - Assign, pick, and release queue items
    - Define routing rule sets to move items to specific queues
    - Set up other Dynamics 365 entities so that they can be used with queues
prerequisites: The target audience should have a basic understanding of how to navigate the Dynamics 365 application. Familiarity with creating and managing cases in Dynamics 365 is also helpful.
