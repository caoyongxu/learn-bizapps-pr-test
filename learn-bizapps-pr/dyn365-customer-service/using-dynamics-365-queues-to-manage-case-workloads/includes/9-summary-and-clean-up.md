As you can see, by enabling and leveraging Dynamics 365 queues, organizations can ensure that cases are always being routed and worked on by agents who are most qualified to do so. Queues can be leveraged for more than just cases. They can be used to support a wide variety of business scenarios.

We looked at several key features and components of leveraging queues including:

-   How to enable additional entities such as leads, opportunities, and     custom entities for use with queues to support other business scenarios such as sale or custom scenarios.
-   Examining the process for creating and defining queues and controlling queue membership with public and private queues.
-   Reviewing how queue members can see which items need attention in which queues, and how to claim responsibility for specific items in those queues.
-   Exploring the ability to define custom logic with routing rules that can be used to ensure that queue items are routed to the best queue based on predefined business criteria.

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding of how Dynamics 365 can be used to define and manage service KPI's for organizations, as well as how to leverage maintenance contracts for their customers.
