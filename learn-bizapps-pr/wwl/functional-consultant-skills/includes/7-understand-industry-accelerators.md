Common Data Model enables horizontal consistency for customers' business data, making it easier for them to create value from that data. However, many customers and partners want solutions and platforms that are tailored for their industry. Microsoft is working closely with representatives from various industries to make Common Data Model more relevant to them, by creating industry accelerators.

With built-in collaboration with industry leaders, the freely available accelerators extend the Common Data Model to include new tables to support a data schema for concepts within specific industries, enabling ISVs and other solution providers to quickly build industry vertical solutions.

Industry accelerators include powerful connected experiences that are designed to support common, existing business needs for specific industries, enabling solutions that deliver new insights and more personalized customer engagements. These connected experiences help simplify efforts to procure partner solutions, or build custom applications, by providing access to a unified data layer that saves customers the time and resources they would have spent creating their own proprietary data layer or attempting to integrate disparate systems and solutions.

Industry accelerators are foundational components within Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 that enable ISVs and other solution providers to quickly build industry vertical solutions. The accelerators extend Common Data Model to include new tables to support a data schema for concepts within specific industries.

Currently available industry accelerators include:
