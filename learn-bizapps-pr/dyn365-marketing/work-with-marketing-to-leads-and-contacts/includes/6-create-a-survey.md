Surveys are used to capture feedback from your customer preferences based primarily on products or services. Through creation and execution of a survey as well as analyzing survey results, you can see the overall likes and dislikes of your customers based on their experiences. In the current version of Dynamics 365 for Marketing, Surveys are provided as a separate application, but it still operates on the same Dynamics 365
applications.

Use the app-selector menu to switch between Surveys and your other Dynamics 365 apps.
