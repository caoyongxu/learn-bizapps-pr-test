It\'s also a core feature of Dynamics 365 for Marketing, which provides tools for creating graphically rich marketing emails with dynamic, personalized content. Dynamics 365 for Marketing can send large volumes of personalized marketing emails, monitor how each recipient interacts with them, drive customer-journey automation based on these interactions, and present results for individual contacts with aggregate statistical analytics. Emails in Dynamics 365 for Marketing are executed through simple or complex customer journeys.
