As you've seen, each time that you create a new email message, customer journey, marketing page, or marketing form, you start by choosing a template. Dynamics 365 for Marketing includes sample templates to get you started, but you'll probably want to build your own to match your organization's requirements and graphical identity.

Email templates often establish a standard visual identity and branding. Therefore, you will want to design content templates in collaboration with your branding team, and reserve content areas for the marketer to
enter content for each specific marketing activity.

When you create an email template, the process is nearly the same as when you create an actual email message. Let's take a look at creating a new email template:

1.  Access Marketing Emails
	-  Go to Marketing > Marketing Execution > Marketing emails
	-  Click + New from the command bar
	-  Select a template

2.  Fill out required details
	-  Name
	-  Subject
	-  From: Search for and select your record
	-  Click to select

3.  Add a subscription center
	- Use the dynamic assist-edit button

4.  **Save as template**
	- Name - this is the name that you will want to use as the email template.
	- Save

5.  Manage templates
	- Go to Marketing > Templates > Marketing Email Template
	- Select your template
	- Change any design elements for your template
	- Save
