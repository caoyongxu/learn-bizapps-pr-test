A **marketing page** is a web page hosted by Dynamics 365 for Marketing and usually includes a form where people can register for an offer, update their contact information, manage mailing list subscriptions, and more. Marketing pages integrate with other Dynamics 365 for Marketing features including email marketing, customer journeys, behavior analysis, lead scoring, and result analytics.

There are 3 types of marketing pages:

- **Landing Pages** - Primary focus is to provide a webpage for input that a visitor can use to sign up for an event, download content, or add to a mailing list.
- **Subscription Centers** - All marketing emails must include a subscription center where recipients can subscribe and unsubscribe.
- **Forward to a Friend** - Provides a page where recipients of your marketing email messages can forward to friends interested in your offer.

> [!Important]
> Marketing pages created and hosted by Dynamics 365 for Marketing use cookies to enable the pre-fill feature for known contacts, and to log when any contact opens a marketing page. Dynamics 365 marketing pages and page templates do not include a cookie-consent feature, so you must add it. One way to do this is by adding JavaScript to the section of your pages using the HTML editor of the page designer. You could also use the built-in privacy statement for marketing pages to announce your use of cookies; however, this might not be sufficient in all jurisdictions because it won't stop the server from setting the cookie-it just informs visitors that cookies are being used.

### Apply video content

Upload your video reference material to your video library hosted in Dynamics 365 for Marketing. For each video that you add to your library, you'll specify a name, video URL, embed code, and thumbnail URL. Note that the library will not store the video itself, only references to it, so you will need to host your video elsewhere like YouTube or Vimeo.

When you add a video to one of your designs, the designer will automatically use the settings it needs for the type of design you are creating. For pages, the designer will embed the video, so visitors can play it without leaving the page. Most email clients don\'t support embedded videos, so the designer will embed the thumbnail image and link it to the video URL allowing contacts to select the thumbnail and open the video in a new browser tab.
