To view contact insights, go to **Marketing** > **Customers** > **Contacts**. Select a contact record, and then open its **Contact: Insights** view.

On the Insights view, you can find a complete history of how your selected contact has interacted with your marketing initiatives. This can help you to understand what this specific contact is interested in and which types of messages they respond to. Marketers might use this information to get deeper knowledge about specific decision makers, so they can better target future initiatives, while a salesperson might use this information to talk to the contact should they choose to reach out to them directly.

For example, you have new product offerings. After you execute marketing initiatives, to learn your contact's interactions and interest levels for each specific product, you can go to the Contact Insights view. Here you can analyze if the specific contact has opened an email, which link(s) they've clicked, and if they've filled out a marketing form. You can use their form responses to segment for future marketing communications. Additionally, a salesperson can navigate to the **Contact Insights** view to determine how best to engage further.
