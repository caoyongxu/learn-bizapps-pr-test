Dynamics 365 is a subscription service that is billed monthly and sets organization-level quotas for the maximum number of marketable contact records, Litmus previews, and monthly marketing email messages that you send. Other quotas may also apply. You can always upgrade your subscription if you need higher quotas. The Quota Management page shows the total quota levels that you have purchased and how much of each quota your organization has already used.

Go to **Settings** \> **Advanced Settings** \> **Other Settings** \> **Quota Limits** to view the following quota limits:
- **Email** - Shows the total number of email messages that you can send this month, and the total number you have sent.
- **Litmus** - Shows the total number of Litmus email previews (inbox previews) that you can request this month, and the total number that you have used.
- **Contact** - Shows the total number of marketable contacts that you can have in your database according to your current Dynamics 365 for Marketing subscription, and how many you actually have. Marketing contacts only include contacts that you engage with for marketing activities such as emails, landing pages, forms, LinkedIn integration, events, and surveys. Contacts that you never engage in marketing activities with won't be counted as part of your Dynamics 365 for Marketing license. While planning your marketing activities, be sure to purchase a subscription that remains within your quota for marketing contacts.
