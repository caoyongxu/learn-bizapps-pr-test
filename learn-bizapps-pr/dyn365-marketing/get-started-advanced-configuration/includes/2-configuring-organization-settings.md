### Manage users

The user accounts and licensing in Dynamics 365 for Marketing work the same way as they do for other Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps. Use Office 365 admin center to create a new user and then purchase and assign licenses for Office 365 and Dynamics 365 for Marketing to the user as needed. After you have done this, you'll see the new user listed on the **Settings** \> **Advanced Settings** \> **Organization** \> **User Management** page.

After you have created a new user, you will use the security model in Dynamics 365 to protect the data integrity and privacy in your Dynamics 365 organization. The security model also promotes efficient data access and collaboration. You combine business units, role-based security, record-based security, and field-based security to define the overall access to information that users have in your Dynamics 365 organization. To learn more, see
[Security concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/security-concepts).

The security roles enable administrators to control which users have access to which features of Dynamics 365. Several security roles are common to almost all Dynamics 365 applications, while others are more specialized. The following list provides access to learn more about each specialized Dynamics 365 for Marketing security role that is available.
