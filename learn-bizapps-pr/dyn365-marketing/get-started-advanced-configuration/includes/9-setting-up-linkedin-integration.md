The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms allows you to automatically sync leads captured on LinkedIn with your Dynamics 365 (online) organization so that your sales and marketing teams can develop them.

To get started, a Dynamics 365 (online) system administrator or customizer installs the [Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850928) by following the instructions in [Install Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms from AppSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/linkedin/install-linkedin-connector).

Before you can sync leads from LinkedIn campaign accounts to a Dynamics 365 organization, a LinkedIn member with access to LinkedIn Campaign Manager is required to authorize their LinkedIn accounts in Dynamics 365 (online). In Dynamics 365 (online), the user must have at least a LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms Connector Salesperson security role. For more information, see [Establish a connection between Dynamics 365
Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms and LinkedIn](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/linkedin/connect-dynamics-365-linkedin).

Next, a campaign manager defines the matching strategy between LinkedIn leads and Dynamics 365 (online) lead records and analyzes individual forms and submissions. For more information, see [Generate Leads in Dynamics 365 for Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/linkedin/connect-dynamics-365-linkedin).

A person filling the roles of both a campaign manager on LinkedIn and a salesperson in Dynamics 365 authorizes Dynamics 365 to receive data from LinkedIn. For more information, see [Generate Leads in Dynamics 365 for Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/linkedin/connect-dynamics-365-linkedin).

Optionally, a sales manager can review the lead performance in a Dynamics 365 (online) dashboard. For more information, see [Generate Leads in Dynamics 365 for Marketing.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/linkedin/connect-dynamics-365-linkedin).
