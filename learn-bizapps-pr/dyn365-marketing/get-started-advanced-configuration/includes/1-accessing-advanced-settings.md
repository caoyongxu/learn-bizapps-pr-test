### Navigate between the Marketing app and Dynamics 365 -- custom app

The Dynamics 365 - custom app is included with Dynamics 365 for Marketing. It combines features from many of the various Dynamics 365 apps you have licensed into a single navigation structure (but most Dynamics 365 for Marketing end-user features arenâ€™t included here). The custom app operates on the same database as Dynamics 365 for Marketing, so settings made in the custom app (including for customization, user administration, events, LinkedIn Lead Gen, or Voice of the Customer) can affect the Marketing app.

To go to the custom app, which provides access to these customization settings, choose **Dynamics 365 - custom** from the app-selector menu, and then go to **Settings** \> **Customization**. The following image shows how to use the app-selector menu to switch between the Marketing and custom apps.

For complete details about how to customize Dynamics 365, see the [Customization Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/overview). The guide describes the interface as you see it in the Dynamics 365 - custom app. The customization features that are also provided in the **Settings** work area of Dynamics 365 for Marketing implement similar concepts, operate on the same database, and work similarly.
