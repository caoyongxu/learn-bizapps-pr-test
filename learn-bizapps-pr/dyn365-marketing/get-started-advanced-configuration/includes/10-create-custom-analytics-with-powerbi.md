Dynamics 365 for Marketing offers a variety of built-in dashboards and insights throughout the application, but you can also create your own custom reports through Power BI.

Microsoft provides endpoints that you can use to connect Power BI to Dynamics 365 for Marketing along with a downloadable Power BI template that you can open in Power BI Desktop, connect to your Dynamics 365 data sources, and then customize as needed. When you're done setting it up, you can publish and share your Power BI report using the standard PowerBI online tools.

This is currently a preview feature. Please read the following note about preview features.
