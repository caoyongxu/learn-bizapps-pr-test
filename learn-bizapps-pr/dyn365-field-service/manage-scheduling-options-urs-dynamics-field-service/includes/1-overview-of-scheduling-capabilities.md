Organizations that manage mobile workforces or deliver services to customers can encounter a wide range of scheduling scenarios and challenges. It is imperative that the person who assigns resources to jobs has all the information they need in order to avoid bad experiences, unhappy customers, and ultimately lose revenue.

There are many things that need to be considered when preparing to schedule resources to deliver items. Organizations need to consider things such as:

-   When is an item ready to be scheduled?
-   Who is qualified to work on this item?
-   When does it need to be done?
-   Is there anything at a customer level that would influence my decision on which resource to schedule?
-   How do we deal with cancellations or requests to reschedule?
-   What if someone is not available?
-   How and what can schedule changes impact?

These are only a few items that organization should consider when getting ready to dispatch items. Additionally, organization might want to consider tools and methods that might be used to schedule items.

Typically, there are three approaches that can be leveraged to schedule items:

-   **Manually:** A dispatcher or scheduler manually identifies people and either schedules or reschedules items accordingly.
-   **Semi-Automated:** Potential qualified resources are suggested based on specific criteria defined on the item they are trying to schedule.
-   **Fully Automated:** Uses algorithms, combined with goals, and constraints to automatically schedule and reschedule items.

Dynamics 365 provides three tools that can be leveraged to assist with each approach:

-   **Manual scheduling with the schedule board:** The schedule board assists in providing dispatchers with the information they need.
    - From the schedule board, they can easily see all the currently unscheduled items as well as the availability of all resources (people, facilities, equipment) and schedule those items directly from the board.
-   **Semi-Automated scheduling with the Schedule Assistant:** 
	-   The schedule assistant can be directly from a work order or from the schedule board. It offers suggestions of potential resources and time slots to schedule an item for. This is based on requirements captured on the record such as skills needed, time windows and more.
-   **Fully Automated scheduling with Resource Scheduling Optimization:** 
	-   Resource scheduling optimization lets organizations automatically schedule and reschedule items based on pre-defined goals. This can include maximizing technician working time, minimizing travel, and scheduling high priority items first.

Resource scheduling optimization requires additional licensing to leverage. Additionally, most organizations want to ensure that their manual scheduling procedures are in place. The organization wants to
understand what those procedures look like including potential exceptions to those procedures before they go the fully automated route.

The primary tool that helps organizations, is the schedule board. From the schedule board, manual as well as semi-automated tools can be leveraged to start identifying and scheduling the right resources for the right projects. Over the remainder of this module we will examine the many ways it can be used to schedule items and service customers better.
