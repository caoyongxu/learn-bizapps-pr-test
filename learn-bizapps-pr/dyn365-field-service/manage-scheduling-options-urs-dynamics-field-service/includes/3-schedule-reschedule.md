Many things can occur throughout a day that can impact scheduling. As these changes or items occur, a dispatcher needs to be able to make schedule changes as quickly as possible. Examples of things that can impact scheduling might include:

-   An emergency work order that was created and needs someone to be scheduled now.
-   A customer canceling or needing to reschedule.
-   A resource calling in sick and needing to find a replacement.
-   An accident that occurred on a specific highway.

Each of these items can present their own set of challenges to dispatchers. Dispatchers need multiple tools at their disposal to meet those needs. The schedule board makes it easy for dispatchers to schedule in these different scenarios by providing multiple ways to schedule an item. These can range from simple drag and drop functionality to schedule an item, to finding a substitute resource that can take over for someone who is no longer available.

There are 4 methods that are most commonly used to schedule items using the schedule board. Those ways are:

-   Using the Requirements Panel
-   Using the Map View
-   Creating time blocks on the calendar
-   Leveraging the Create Resource booking panel

Some of the methods included in the requirements panel and the map view provide multiple options that are used to schedule items using that method.

Let's examine the different ways items can be scheduled using the Schedule Board.


### Schedule from the Requirements Panel

The requirements panel displays a list of all the currently active resource requirements that need to be scheduled. Each requirement will include items like the duration required, priority, and time windows promised. Items can be scheduled from the requirements panel in two ways:

-   **Drag and Drop:** Simply drag the item from the requirements panel to the schedule board.

-   **Find Availability:** Leverages schedule assistant to find resources and schedule an item.

#### Drag and Drop

The drag and drop option is the simplest way to schedule something on the schedule board. The dispatcher will simply select the item they want to schedule and drag it up on the board. Once they have found the
resource they want to schedule the item for, they drop the item in the time slot they want, and the application will create the booking and place it on the board.

When using drag and drop, it is important to note that by default you are not prevented from scheduling an item for a resource.

For example, let's say a customer was promised a time window of 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM. When dragging the requirement to the schedule board, if you are outside of the window promised the text color will change to
red. Once you are in the window promised the text will change to green. Even though the text color does change, you are not prevented from scheduling outside of the window. Organizations that want to prevent an
item from being scheduled if specific requirements are not met, can do so using what are called booking rules.

#### Find Availability

While drag and dropping is a quick way to schedule, it does not consider any skills, territories, or other predefined items outlined in the requirement. To assist in considering any specific items needed, dispatchers can use the Find Availability feature. When a dispatcher selects a requirement in the panel, they can click find availability on the record, and it will open the schedule assistant.

Any available resources that meet the criteria specified in the resource requirement will be displayed. The criteria that was used to filter the request will be displayed in the filter view. If you need to expand the
results returned, the criteria can be modified as needed for that specific request.

For the resources that are returned by the assistant, blocks of time will be displayed based on their availability, and will include travel time estimates based on the resources current location. The dispatcher can select any time within that block to schedule the resource for the item. Once a time is selected, a resource booking screen is presented where the details can be modified. Once you are ready to book the item, click the book or book & exit button to create the booking.

### Scheduling using the Map view filter

When you use the map view from the Filter and Map view panel, it provides several tools that can be helpful for a dispatcher to use. One of the key advantages to the map is to be able to visually see where items that need to be scheduled are, compared to the location of the resource and other items being scheduled. For example, if Christie is scheduled to work on a ticket in a specific part of town at 2:00 PM, we can identify any unscheduled items in that area, and assign them to her to do on the way to her 2:00 PM appointment.

When Dispatchers are using the map view, the way to schedule items available are very similar to what was available from the requirement panel, however with one key difference. Dispatchers can visualize who the item should be assigned to by using the map.

Items are still available to be scheduled using:

-   **Drag and Drop:** Simply drag the item from the map panel to the schedule board.
-   **Find Availability:** Leverages schedule assistant to find resources and schedule an item.

#### Drag and Drop

Let's see how the map could enhance the drag and drop experience. The image below represents what a dispatcher might see when using the map view:

![Find Availability](../media/MSO-Unit3-2.png)

We can see from the image the following:

-   Christie has a work order scheduled for today at 12:30.
    -   The map shows the most likely route for Christie to take.
-   There is an unscheduled work order that falls on Christie's route.
    -   The item is estimated to last two hours.
    -   Christie has 2 hours free today before her 12:30 appointment.

In this instance we can easily drag the requirement pin on the map and place it in an available time slot for Christie. Once it has been scheduled for Christie, the route on the map will change to show the newly scheduled item.

#### Find Availability

Another option is to use Find Availability. The difference with find availability using the map, is that it can be accessed by hovering over the pin on the schedule directly. Once you click the find availability, you will be taken to the same schedule assistant screen that we
mentioned previously.

### Blocking time for a resource

When you see that a resource has an available time slot open that you want to fill, you can drag to select the amount of time you want to fill for the resource on the calendar. For example, you could drag a 2 hour
from 1:00 PM to 3:00 for Wayne. You will be provided with a list of work orders that could be scheduled for that time. After you select the item you want, a booking will be created and placed on the calendar.

### Using the Create Resource Booking Panel

The Create Resource Booking panel is leveraged when you are engaging the schedule assistant using the Find  Availability feature. It can also provide a great way to schedule items directly from the schedule board.

The Create Resource Booking panel can be accessed by either expanding the panel or clicking the book button on the schedule board toolbar. Once you have displayed the panel, you need to select a requirement record, and the panel will be populated with the following information:

-   **Resource:** Specifies the resource this booking will be assigned to.
-   **Start Date:** Start date of the booking. (Defaults to today)
-   **Start Time:** Start time of the booking. (Defaults to 8:00 AM)
-   **End Date:** End date of the booking. (Defaults to today)
-   **End Time:** End time of the booking. (Defaults to 8:00 AM)
-   **Booking Status:** Status to assign to the booking.
-   **Booking Method:** Defines how hours are allocated.

You will need to provide the specific resource that you want to create the booking for. You will also need to modify the starting and ending information. Once it is ready to book, you can click the book button to
create the booking and display on the schedule board.

### Scheduling Directly from a Work Order

Sometimes you may want to schedule an item without even going into the schedule board. You may find that it is just as easy to schedule the item directly from the work order. The schedule assistant that we leveraged earlier, can also be initiated directly from the work order by clicking the book button.

When the schedule assist loads, it will show potential resources that could be scheduled. A single resource could be returned multiple times depending on their availability during the period specified in the filter. As was mentioned previously with the schedule assistant, the filter criteria used can be modified to expand or reduce the number of results returned.

![Filter View](../media/MSO-Unit3-7.png)

There are several reasons why items might not be displayed in the Schedule Assistant. You may need to check values on records to ensure that they can be returned by the assistant. The most common things to check first are:

-   **No Resources meet the characteristics defined:** Look at the filter criteria that is being used. Make sure that you have resources that meet those requirements. You can remove criteria to see if results are returned. If you are still not seeing results, it could be an address issue.
-   **Starting and ending locations associated with the resources:** If the address associated with a resource cannot be located, the resource will not be returned. A resource's starting and ending locations are defined on the resource record, and can be set to either resource address, organizational unit address or location agnostic.
    -   **Resource Address:** If the resource address is used, ensure that you have valid address information (latitude and longitude) for the address being used based on the resource type.
        -   **Resource Type = Account:** Address of account record related to the resource.
        -   **Resource Type = Contact:** Address of the contact record related to the resource.
        -   **Resource Type = User:** Address associated with the user's Office 365 account.
    -   **Organization Unit Address:** If the organizational unit is being used, ensure that it has valid latitude and longitude values.
