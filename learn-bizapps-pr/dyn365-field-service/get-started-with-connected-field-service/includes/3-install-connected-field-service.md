## Exercise â€“ Installing Connected Field Service

In this exercise, you'll set up your environment, install the Connected Field Service app, and create a deployment.

### Set up the environment

Create a trial environment or reset an existing test environment, and set it up for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service. This installs the Field Service application. To this base deployment, you'll add the Connected Field Service add-on. Make sure that sample data is enabled in your lab environment.

It's important that you not do this exercise in your production environment. Always do exercises in a demo or sandbox instance.
