When you're working in the field, it is critical that to have all the information you need to complete the job at hand. In addition to a job summary, it's helpful to have:

- Scannable barcodes of items being serviced, or new items being installed.
- Links to product manuals of the items they are working in.
- Step-by-step directions.
- Barcode scanners for capturing item serial numbers.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service Mobile is designed with field agents in mind. You can easily view your schedule; browse customers, work orders, and bookings on a map; and use GPS information to get to customer locations.

You can use Field Service Mobile either offline or online. Your organization can determine which mode is available to which users, and when and how they can use each mode.

### Working with Bookings

When you select **Bookings**, an agenda view will display all of your active bookings. You'll see today's bookings by default, but you can use the arrows to go to bookings for other days. A filter provides the ability to work with different months and years if needed.

When you select a booking, you'll see details about the booking such as the current booking status, duration, and cost information. Items like miles traveled can be auto populated as you travel from one customer location to another.

You can drill into the work order associated with each booking. When you go to the work order, you'll have access to all the tasks, products, and services associated with the work order. You can create tasks and items as needed as you conduct the work order. Additional items, like capturing a customer signature, can be completed from the work order as well.

When you've completed the work, you can change the status of the booking and the work order will be updated to reflect the status. 

### Time Off Requests

Time off requests provide access to all the time off requests you've submitted. You can create new requests by clicking **New** in the upper right-hand corner.

### Map

When you select **Map**, you'll see your current location on an interactive map. By default, the map will display accounts, work orders, and bookings that are in the area where you're working. You can filter which items to display or search for a specific record.
