Work orders are the primary item you'll generate and schedule with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service.  While it's possible to generate and schedule other items, field agents will typically devote most of their time to delivering service on customer work orders. Before implementing Field Service, your organization should have a good understanding of scheduling requirements, what to include in work orders, and the process used to create them.  One consideration that can impact delivery of services to customers is inventory and inventory levels.  Because inventory is almost always included on work orders and might be stored or transported from multiple places, your organization should know their storage locations and how to move inventory between them.
