    - content: Product
      incorrectExplanation: Customer Asset record type can be registered as an IoT device. 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Case
      incorrectExplanation: Customer Asset record type can be registered as an IoT device. 
      isCorrect: false
  - content: You have a device that has triggered an alert.  You want to remotely reset the device from Dynamics 365.  What should you create?  
    choices: 
    - content: Command Definition
      incorrectExplanation: Create a Command to remotely reset a device that has triggered an alert.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Property Definition
      incorrectExplanation: Create a Command to remotely reset a device that has triggered an alert.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Device Property
      incorrectExplanation: Create a Command to remotely reset a device that has triggered an alert.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Command
      correctExplanation: Create a Command to remotely reset a device that has triggered an alert. 
      isCorrect: true
    - content: Customer Asset
      incorrectExplanation: Create a Command to remotely reset a device that has triggered an alert. 
      isCorrect: false
  - content: You have an IoT device that has registered a temperature reading above 70 degrees and triggered an alert.  You need to find the exact reading value to determine what range it falls into to determine the next course of action.  What should you do? 
    choices: 
    - content: Create a workflow that pulls the reading value directly from the alert data field on the IoT alert.
      incorrectExplanation: Call the JSON-Based Field Value Get Number action in a workflow to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a workflow that pulls the reading value from the title field on the IoT alert.
      incorrectExplanation: Call the JSON-Based Field Value Get Number action in a workflow to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a workflow that calls the JSON-Based Field Value Get Boolean action to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      incorrectExplanation: Call the JSON-Based Field Value Get Number action in a workflow to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a workflow that calls the JSON-Based Field Value Get Number action to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      correctExplanation: Call the JSON-Based Field Value Get Number action in a workflow to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      isCorrect: true
  - content: You have an IoT device that has generated a temperature alert in Connected Field Service.  If the temperature is above 70 but below 80, the issue is first attempted to be resolved by a case, and then a work order if the case cannot be resolved.  If the temperature is above 80 degrees, a work order is created.  There are specific items that need to be captured for both the case and work order.   How would you accomplish this? 
    choices: 
    - content: Create a non-branching business process flow that starts on the IoT alert entity.
      incorrectExplanation: Branching business process flows that start on an IoT alert entity.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a non-branching business process flow that starts on the case entity.
      incorrectExplanation: Branching business process flows that start on an IoT alert entity.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a non-branching business process flow that starts on the work order entity. 
      incorrectExplanation: Branching business process flows that start on an IoT alert entity.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a branching business process flow that starts on the IoT alert entity.  
      correctExplanation: Branching business process flows that start on an IoT alert entity. 
      isCorrect: true
    - content: Create a branching business process flow that starts on the case entity.  
      incorrectExplanation: Branching business process flows that start on an IoT alert entity. 
      isCorrect: false
