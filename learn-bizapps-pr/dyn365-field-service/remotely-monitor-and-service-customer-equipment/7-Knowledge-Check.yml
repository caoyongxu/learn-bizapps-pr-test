      incorrectExplanation: TBD 
      isCorrect: false
  - content: You have an IoT device that has registered a temperature reading of above 70 degrees and triggered an alert.  You need to find the exact reading value to determine what range it falls into, so you determine the next course of action.  What should you do? 
    choices: 
    - content: Create a workflow that pulls the reading value directly from the alert data field on the IoT alert.
      incorrectExplanation: TBD
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a workflow that pulls the reading value from the title field on the IoT alert.
      incorrectExplanation: TBD
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a workflow that calls the JSON-Based Field Value Get Boolean action to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      incorrectExplanation: TBD
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Create a workflow that calls the JSON-Based Field Value Get Number action to pull the reading value from the alert data field. 
      correctExplanation: TBD 
      isCorrect: true
  - content: You have an IoT device that has generated a temperature alert in Connected Field Service.  If the temperature is above 70 but below 80, the issue is first attempted to be resolved by a case, and then a work order if the case cannot be resolved.  If the temperature is above 80 degrees, a work order is created.  There are specific items that need to be captured for both the case and work order.   How would you accomplish this? 
    choices: 
    - content: Create a non-branching business process flow that starts on the IoT alert entity.
      incorrectExplanation: TBD
      isCorrect: false
