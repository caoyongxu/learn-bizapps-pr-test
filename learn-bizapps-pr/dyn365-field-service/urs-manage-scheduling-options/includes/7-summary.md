As you can see, there are multiple ways that items such as work orders can be scheduled the schedule board and schedule assistant.  Items can be placed on the schedule board using its drag and drop functionality, or they can be scheduled by letting the schedule assistant look for and suggest resources that possess the qualifications needed.  Because circumstances around scheduling items can vary, it is important for the people who are responsible for dispatching items to identify the best way to schedule an item depending on what is required.        
    
We examined the many ways items can be scheduled and rescheduled including:

- Exploring the schedule boards overall functionality and scheduling capabilities such as how the requirements, details, and filter panels are used.      
- Examining how resources are presented in on the schedule board and the different options for moving them around.  
- How to use the requirements panel to schedule items.  We saw how items can be placed on the board by dragging and dropping them in the time slots desired.  We also looked at how to leverage the schedule assistant using the Find Availability feature.  
- Examining the schedule boards interactive map feature and how it can be leveraged to schedule items.  
- Examining how the schedule assistant can be leveraged directly from an item like a work order to schedule a resource.
- How Items can be rescheduled or resources can be substituted when previously scheduled resources are not available.  

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding of the customization capabilities available for the schedule board.  This would include working with multiple boards, view configuring, and defining default filter information.
