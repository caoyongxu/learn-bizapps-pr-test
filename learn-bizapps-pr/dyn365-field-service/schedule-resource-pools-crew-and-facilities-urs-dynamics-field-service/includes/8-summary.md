The latest version of Universal Resource Scheduling provides some long-awaited enhancements to provide additional scheduling scenarios in the application.  One of the key areas, includes scheduling multiple resources for a single item.  Users can now leverage three new options.  They can schedule items using crews, resource pools, or with requirement groups and requirement group templates.  Additionally, organizations that need to define scheduling windows or provide predictable scheduling patterns can accommodate those specific needs as well.  

We examined some of the key new enhancements to Universal Resource Scheduling including:

- Exploring scenarios that may require schedule multiple resources for a single requirement. 
- Examining how to define facility type resources and where those facilities can be leveraged in the scheduling process.  
- How resource pools can be defined and used to note when a type of resource is needed.  We also examined the processes for replacing the generic resource pool that was scheduled with specific resources from the pool later.  
- Examining how crews can be used to schedule pre-defined groups of workers on the schedule board.  
- Exploring how requirement groups and requirement group templates can be used to group multiple requirement records together into a single groups record. 
- How to leverage the new schedule board features such as split views for working with resource pools and crews, as well as how to add requirement groups views to the requirements panel. 

The next steps from here would be to start exploring how Dynamics 365 for Field Serviceâ€™s connected field service solution can be used to build a proactive IoT solution strategy.  This would include understanding the scenarios where devices can be remotely managed and serviced, interacting with IoT enabled devices remotely, and how to leverage IoT central for management scenarios.
