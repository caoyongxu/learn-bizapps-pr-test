Universal Resource Scheduling and the schedule board provide two ways to schedule and reschedule resources, requirements, and bookings in the system by default.  Items such as work orders can be manually scheduled using the schedule board, or the schedule assistant can be used to provide some additional constraint filtering based on requirement records.  Organizations that need to manage large amounts of resources may look at a more automated solution where bookings are auto-created and optimized so dispatchers can focus on the anomalies.  The Resource Scheduling Optimization solution provides these capabilities.  

We examined some of the key capabilities of the Resource Scheduling Optimization feature including:

- How the solution is deployed to an existing Dynamics 365 instance, and the organizational requirements.  
- Exploring the configuration process including how to enable it in an organization and define which booking status, resources, and requirement records will leverage the optimization service.  
- Examining what optimization goals are, how they are used by the RSO service, and the process for creating them.  
- Exploring optimization scopes including what they define, how to populate the records that are included in the scope, and the different time options available.  
- How to define an optimization schedule.  
- Examining how to use an optimization schedule, where to find the records that were included, and overall job administration.  
- Exploring how the single resource optimization feature is used. 

The next steps from here would be to start exploring how Dynamics 365 for Field Serviceâ€™s connected field service solution can be used to build a proactive IoT solution strategy.  This would include understanding the scenarios where devices can be remotely managed and serviced, interacting with IoT enabled devices remotely, and how to leverage IoT central for management scenarios.
