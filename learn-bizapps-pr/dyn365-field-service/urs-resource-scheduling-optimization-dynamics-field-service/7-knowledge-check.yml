  questions:
  - content: You want to create a scope that will be used to optimize existing scheduled items based on the type of work order it is associated with.  Which entity is used to provide this data?      
    choices: 
    - content: Resource Requirement
      explanation: Every optimization scope that is created needs to specify the resources that should be optimized.  Additionally, a scope must also provide either the requirements, or bookings that should be optimized.  The resource requirement entity is used to create new bookings, the bookable resource booking entity is used to optimize any existing bookings.  Source - Defining Optimization Scopes 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Bookable Resource Booking 
      explanation: Every optimization scope that is created needs to specify the resources that should be optimized.  Additionally, a scope must also provide either the requirements, or bookings that should be optimized.  The resource requirement entity is used to create new bookings, the bookable resource booking entity is used to optimize any existing bookings.  Source - Defining Optimization Scopes 
      isCorrect: true
    - content: Bookable Resource
      explanation: Every optimization scope that is created needs to specify the resources that should be optimized.  Additionally, a scope must also provide either the requirements, or bookings that should be optimized.  The resource requirement entity is used to create new bookings, the bookable resource booking entity is used to optimize any existing bookings.  Source - Defining Optimization Scopes 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Work Order
      explanation: Every optimization scope that is created needs to specify the resources that should be optimized.  Additionally, a scope must also provide either the requirements, or bookings that should be optimized.  The resource requirement entity is used to create new bookings, the bookable resource booking entity is used to optimize any existing bookings.  Source - Defining Optimization Scopes 
      isCorrect: false
  - content: Which of the following objectives cannot be used as the first objective in an Optimization Goal?      
    choices: 
    - content: Minimize travel time 
      explanation: Each objective that is defined can have number value defined for the order.  Objectives are evaluated based on that numeric order.  Minimizing total travel time cannot be the first objective in the list. If minimize total travel time was the first objective, RSO might not schedule anything with the travel time of 0 minutes to meet the first objective.   Source - Defining Optimization Goals
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Maximize total working hours
      explanation: Each objective that is defined can have number value defined for the order.  Objectives are evaluated based on that numeric order.  Minimizing total travel time cannot be the first objective in the list. If minimize total travel time was the first objective, RSO might not schedule anything with the travel time of 0 minutes to meet the first objective.   Source - Defining Optimization Goals
      isCorrect: false
    - content: High priority requirements
      explanation: Each objective that is defined can have number value defined for the order.  Objectives are evaluated based on that numeric order.  Minimizing total travel time cannot be the first objective in the list. If minimize total travel time was the first objective, RSO might not schedule anything with the travel time of 0 minutes to meet the first objective.   Source - Defining Optimization Goals
      isCorrect: true
    - content: Maximize preferred resources
      explanation: Each objective that is defined can have number value defined for the order.  Objectives are evaluated based on that numeric order.  Minimizing total travel time cannot be the first objective in the list. If minimize total travel time was the first objective, RSO might not schedule anything with the travel time of 0 minutes to meet the first objective.   Source - Defining Optimization Goals
      isCorrect: false
  - content: Which of the following optimization schedule statuses identifies that the published version of the optimization schedule does not match the current version?
    choices: 
    - content: Out of Sync 
      explanation: A schedule will exist in one of many statuses throughout its lifecycle.  When changes are made to an existing schedule that is published, the status of the schedule will change to Out of Sync to let you know that it will need to be published again.  Source - Defining Optimization Goals
      isCorrect: true
    - content: Unpublished
      explanation: A schedule will exist in one of many statuses throughout its lifecycle.  When changes are made to an existing schedule that is published, the status of the schedule will change to Out of Sync to let you know that it will need to be published again.  Source - Defining Optimization Goals
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Under Maintenance
      explanation: A schedule will exist in one of many statuses throughout its lifecycle.  When changes are made to an existing schedule that is published, the status of the schedule will change to Out of Sync to let you know that it will need to be published again.  Source - Defining Optimization Goals
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Failed
      explanation: A schedule will exist in one of many statuses throughout its lifecycle.  When changes are made to an existing schedule that is published, the status of the schedule will change to Out of Sync to let you know that it will need to be published again.
