The Schedule Board provides a wide range of customization options that can be used to tailor it to fit the scheduling needs of an organization. This could range from creating multiple schedule board tabs that to support scheduling for multiple locations, to defining custom filter controls that would be used to filter the resources presented on the board.

We examined several of the key customization options available including:

-   Examining scenarios where leveraging multiple Schedule Board tabs would be beneficial as well as the process for creating and sharing them.
-   Exploring the different Schedule Board configuration options available such as controlling map placement and color modifications.
-   Examining how Dynamics 365 views are used to populate and filter the data that is presented in the Schedule Board.
-   How to change the views associated with specific Schedule Board elements.
-   Exploring the options available for extending Schedule Board functionality by modifying Schedule Board queries.

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding around advanced scheduling scenarios and options, including: crew scheduling, managing resource requirement groups, and even automated scheduling using Resource Scheduling Optimization.
