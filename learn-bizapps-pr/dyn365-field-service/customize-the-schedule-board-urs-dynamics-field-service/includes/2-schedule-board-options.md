Each schedule board tab that is added has options that can be modified for it. Schedule board options can be modified by either double clicking on the schedule board tab you want to modify the settings for, or by clicking on the tab settings button. When you click on the tab settings button it will display the schedule board settings for the schedule board that is currently selected.

Each schedule board tab has three areas that can be used to assist in the configuration of that specific board. These areas provide options from placement of objects to views that are used to render data on the
board. Those areas are:

-   **General Settings:** Defines items such as views used for board elements, placement of items on the board, and colors.
-   **Schedule Types:** Defines the views are used to display and filter items, such as bookings and requirements for each entity that is enabled for Universal Resource Scheduling.
-   **Requirements Panel:** Allows an organization to add additional requirement tabs to the requirements panel at the bottom of the schedule board.
    -   For example, you may create a panel tab that only shows unscheduled work orders where the work orders have a system sub-status of parts arrived.

While each schedule board tab is configured independently, there are default settings that can be defined. These settings are used for every schedule board tab unless otherwise specified. The default settings can
be accessed by clicking on the Open Default Settings button.
