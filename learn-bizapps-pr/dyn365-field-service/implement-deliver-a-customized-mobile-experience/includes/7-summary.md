Since the Field Service Mobile application uses Rescoâ€™s Woodford solution as the customization engine for tailoring the application to meet different organizational needs, it is important that users who will be implementing Dynamics 365 for Field Service understand the capabilities available.  As was mentioned throughout the module, Resco has a large quantity of detailed step-by-step training materials available that will assist in customizing the application.  Our intent was to provide some ideas and starting points on what customers are looking for with the mobile application.  
        
We looked at several use cases where customizing the application would be required including:

- Examining common discovery questions and requests customers often have when it comes to the mobile solution.    
- Exploring how views are used in and how to enhance them with items like Row Scripts.  
- Examining the process of customizing the forms that are used in the mobile application and how delivering a customer solution often involves customizations to multiple areas.
- How form rules are used with commands to execute custom scripting functionality.  

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding the full customization options available using the Resco Woodford solution. For more about customization options, see the [Resco Mobile CRM Woodford Guide](https://www.resco.net/woodford-user-guide/).
