Dynamics 365â€™s Connected Field Service solution provides the ability to remotely monitor IoT enabled devices to keep track of up time, device statistics, anomalies and more.  After an IoT device communicates an anomaly or exception, that information is sent to Connected Field Service as an alert.  Once the alert is captured, IoT devices can be remotely managed and interacted with using IoT device commands from within Dynamics 365.  To assist in flexibility, the data populated in these commands can be easily populated using command and property definitions.   
 
The purpose of this hands-on-lab is to introduce you to creating and defining command and property definitions in Connected Field Service.  Additionally, we will demonstrate how you can automate the process of sending commands using Dynamics 365 functionality.   
 
**Learning Objectives** 
- At the end of these exercises, you will be able to accomplish the following: 
- Create device categories in Connected Field Service. 
- Create and define command definitions.  
- Create and define command definitions and use them in command definitions.  
- Build workflows extract data and automate send a command. 
  
**Scenario**
You work for a plumbing and heating company that sells and services smart home devices.  Since many of the devices that you service are smart devices, information from those devices can be captured remotely to aid in the servicing of that equipment.  Your organization has several defined scenarios that and processes that they use when servicing equipment.  

These processes can vary depending on several factors including: 
- Type of device in need of service 
- Severity of the issue detected 
- Age of the device 
- Location of the device 
- Availability of resources to work on a specific device 
- The above items represent only a small portion of factors that your organization uses to determine the process for servicing equipment.   
 
Lately, you have been installing a lot of smart thermostat devices.  These devices have been very handy in being able to track temperature and humidity readings in areas when it is important to maintain a consistent temperature and humidity.  Because you have more information available it has forced you to create new process for handling and resolving issues reported by these devices.  The first area you would like to focus on is for automating the process used for temperature related issues. 
  
Your organization is looking to implement the following process: 
If a device detects a temperature reading of more than 70 degrees, an alert should be surfaced in your Connect Field Service environment.   
 
If the temperature reading is between 70 and 85 degrees, a command should be sent to remotely reset the device to see if the issue resolves itself.   
 
Your organization wants to make it as easy as possible for techs to create commands and modify parameters.  They would like to pre-define a few of the commands and properties that are common to these smart thermostat devices.   
 
The two commands they want to pre-define are: 
- Notification: {"CommandName":"Notification","Parameters":{"Message":"Technician has been dispatched"}} 
- Set Values: {"CommandName":"Set Values","Parameters":{"Reading":{"Temperature":"30","Humidity":"30"}}}
