## Working with Device Properties and Definitions

Property Definitions make it easy to pre-define specific properties that are associated with IoT Devices.  There are two primary areas where Property Definitions can be leveraged. 
 
- Assisting in syncing and communicating with Device Twins
- Streamlining population of properties in Command Definitions.  

A Property Definition contains the following information:

- Name: The name of the specific property.  In our above example, Message would be set as the name, since that is the Property we want to define.  

- Type: Defines the type of Property it is.  You have six different types to choose from.
