The Universal Resource Scheduling (URS) solution for Dynamics 365 is the foundation framework that items like Field Service work orders and Project Service Automation projects are scheduled with. It lets organizations define the items that they want to schedule, the resources (people, facilities, equipment) that can be scheduled, and even skills that may be required. Organizations that are looking to leverage URS for their scheduling needs, can configure several aspects of the application.

We examined the Universal Resource Scheduling configuration process
including:

-   Examining the specific required components that are used by Universal Resource Scheduling such as enabling the mapping functionality and creating the Organizational Units that resources could potentially be dispatched from.

-   How Resource Skills and Roles are used by URS to determine resources qualified to work on items. Additionally, we explored the process of configuring the proficiency models used with resource skills.

-   How to create bookable resources. Examining many components that can be configured for resources, including; defining resource location information, defining resource characteristics and roles, associating resources with territories, and defining work hours.

-   Exploring how to define crews, resource pools, and facilities.

-   Examining the process that is used to enable an entity to be used for resource scheduling.

The next steps from here would be to gain a deeper understanding of how items in Dynamics 365 would be scheduled using Universal Resource Scheduling. This would include using the schedule board to manually schedule items, leveraging the schedule assistant, and exploring some of the customization options available.
