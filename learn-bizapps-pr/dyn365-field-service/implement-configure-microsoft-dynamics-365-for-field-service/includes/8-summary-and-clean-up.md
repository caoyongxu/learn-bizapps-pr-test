When preparing to deploy Dynamics 365 for Field Service, it is important to consider how the application will be deployed.  The implementation team should consider the types of work orders they provide, when items are ready to be scheduled, the service areas they cover, and anything else that can impact the delivery of services to their customers. 
 
In this module, you learned to:

- Identify considerations for deploying Field Service.  
- Create organizational units and territories, and understand their impact on scheduling.  
- Define how products and services are used in Field Service by using the Field Service Type field.  
- Define work order types, statuses, and substatuses, and apply best practices to customizing them.  
- Use incident types as templates to populate necessary items such as products, services, tasks, and skills on work orders.  
- Explore how settings defined at an account level impact what info is populated in work orders, and how work orders can be scheduled.  
 
### Next steps

Your next steps are to gain a deeper understanding of the scheduling and delivery of services with Field Service.  You'll learn to use tools like the Schedule Board and Scheduling Assistant, and to deliver services using the mobile application.
