In this section, you will discover and use AI Builder actions in Power Automate through the creation of a simple flow.

Start by [signing in](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true) to Power Automate and then following all instructions in this section.

## Create a flow from a solution

To add AI Builder actions in a flow, create the flow from a Microsoft Dataverse solution.

1. Go to **Solutions** from the navigation bar on the left.

2. Create a new solution called **My AI Builder solution** and then open it.

3. Select **+New > Flow** in the action bar on the top of the screen. The flow designer screen appears and asks you to choose the trigger action.

4. In the **Triggers** section, select **Manually trigger a flow > + Add an input > Text**. Name your input **My Text**, as shown in the following figure.

    ![Add an action to flow.](../media/03-pick-up-flow-trigger.png)

5. Select **+ New step**. You will now add an AI Builder action.

### Search for and add an AI Builder action

In this example, you will add the AI Builder action that allows sentiment analysis. Choose one of the following options to help you accomplish this task:

- Search for intent, for example, "Analyze sentiment."

    ![Sentiment intent action.](../media/03-add-action.png)

- Open the AI Builder action group.

    ![Chose a flow action.](../media/03-ai-builder-action.png)

    This action group lists all available AI Builder actions. You can pick the action from that page.

    ![List of actions.](../media/03-ai-builder-flow.png)

- Use the generic **Predict** action that allows you to use any type of model.

For this exercise, select the **Analyze positive or negative sentiment in text** action.

### Configure the AI Builder action

Each AI Builder action has different parameters, depending on the underlying model requirements.

For the AI Builder sentiment analysis model, **Language** and **Text** are the two mandatory fields to fill in.

1. In the **Language** field, select **English** as the language.

2. In the **Text** field, select **My Text**, which is defined in the trigger action.

    ![Analyze positive or negative sentiment.](../media/03-sentiment.png)

    The **My Text** value will be provided during flow testing, so you don't need to focus on it right now.

3. Select **Save.** Your flow is now saved with an autogenerated name. You can change it by selecting the generated name on the upper-left corner of the flow designer screen. Name your flow **My AI Builder flow**.

### Use the model's inference

For this exercise, you will use a Microsoft Excel file in OneDrive to store the text sentiment that is detected by the AI model.

1.  Create an Excel file named **AI Builder results.xlsx** in your OneDrive.

2.  In this file, insert a table with two columns and then save the file (make sure that you use the **Insert > Table** function of Excel).

    ![Excel file showing columns.](../media/03-excel.png)

3.  In **My AI Builder flow**, select **+ New step** and then add the **Add a row into a table** action from Excel Online (Business).

4.  Complete the **Location**, **Document Library**, and **File** fields to point to the Excel file on your machine.

5.  In the **Table** field, select the name of the table that you created in your Excel file.

6.  In the **Column 1** field, add **My Text**, and in the **Column 2** field, add **Overall text sentiment**.

    ![Add a row to a table flow.](../media/03-add-table.png)

7.  Select **Save**.

### Test the flow

Before productizing a flow, it's always a good idea to test it during design phase.

1.  Select **Test** on the upper-right corner of the flow designer screen.

2.  Select **I'll perform the trigger action** and the select **Save & Test**.

3.  Provide the value of the **My Text** field from the trigger action. This text is what you want to analyze the sentiment for.

    ![My text field for trigger.](../media/03-my-text.png)

4.  Select **Run flow**. If your flow ran successfully, you would see all steps shown with a green tick.

    ![Green steps complete.](../media/03-steps-complete.png)

5.  You can expand the actions to view the running inputs and outputs of each action, which is a good way to debug your flow.

6.  Check that the line has been correctly added in the Excel file.

Congratulations, you have successfully created your first AI Builder flow.
