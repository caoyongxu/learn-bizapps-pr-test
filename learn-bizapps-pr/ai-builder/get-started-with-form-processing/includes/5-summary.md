Congratulations on creating your first Form processing model with AI Builder.
In this module, you discovered the basics of the Form processing AI capability and how you can use a published model in Power Apps and Power Automate.
Specifically, you learned that:
- Your model learns from the documents that you use to train.
- A Form processor component for canvas apps will allow you to extract form fields from documents by using your model.
- You can extract form fields from documents within flows by using the predict action to call your model.
