Learn how other people in your organization can use your model.

By default, only you can see the models you create and publish. This
feature allows you to test them and use them within apps and flows without exposing them.

If you want others to use your model, you can share it with specific
users, groups, or your whole organization.

### Share your model

1.  Click **AI Builder > Models** on the left menu.
2.  Find your model name and select it to access its details page.
3.  In the top left corner of the screen, select **Share**.

### Use a shared model

In addition to the models you create yourself, the models that are shared with you by others appear on the **Models** page, accessible from the left menu.

When a model is shared with you, you have user permissions to use it in
apps and flows. You cannot view details or edit the model.

You now know how to share your model with other people in your organization.
