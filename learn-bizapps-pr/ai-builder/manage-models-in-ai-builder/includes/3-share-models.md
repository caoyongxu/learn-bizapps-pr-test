In this unit you will learn how other people in your organization can
use your model.

By default, only you can see the models you create and publish. This
allows you to test them and use them within apps and flows without
exposing them.

If you want others to use your model, you can share it with specific
users, groups, or your whole organization.

### Share your model

1.  Click AI Builder \>Models in the left-side menu.

2.  Find your model name and click it to access its details page.

3.  In the top left corner of the screen, click Share.

### Use a shared model

In addition to the models you create yourself, the models that are
shared with you by others appear on the Models page, accessible from the
left-side menu.

height="1.8681517935258092in"}

When a model is shared with you, you have user permissions to use it in
apps and flows. You cannot view details or edit the model.
