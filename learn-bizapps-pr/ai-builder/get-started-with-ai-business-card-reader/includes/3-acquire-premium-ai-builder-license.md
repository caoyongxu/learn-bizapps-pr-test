You can purchase several AI Builder add-ons. Each add-on will entitle your tenant to one million AI Builder credits, which is the currency that is used by AI Builder.

To know how many add-ons you need, you can use the AI Builder Calculator by going to [https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder-calculator/](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpowerapps.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fai-builder-calculator%2F&data=02%7C01%7CAntoine.DeFontenay%40microsoft.com%7C8443f0f14c8f49421d5208d7ab801905%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637166439027827401&sdata=4jnB75CaNQoZmnuSByzAwBa5Cf%2BDDPOjgy218rn0a7M%3D&reserved=0).

At the end of this process, your tenant will automatically be entitled to AI Builder credits. This entitlement will remain for as long as you keep your license active. You can use the same channel to purchase additional AI Builder Capacity add-ons or to remove some. This modification will automatically adjust your entitlement of AI Builder credits at the end of the grace period.

AI Builder capacity is also included with other first party licenses such as Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise Edition.

You might want to check how many AI Builder credits that your tenant is entitled to, which is task to complete. Go to Power Platform Admin Center and select **Analytics > Capacity**, or you can go to <https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/analytics/capacity>.
