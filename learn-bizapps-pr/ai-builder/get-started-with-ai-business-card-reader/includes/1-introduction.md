### Introduction to the Business card model

The prebuilt Business card AI model allows you to extract information from business card images. If it detects a business card in the image, the AI model extracts the information such as name, job title, address, email, company, and phone numbers.

In AI Builder, you have access to a wide range of different business card designs and formats. AI builder is constantly improving the accuracy of the Business card AI model to better identify the different fields in your business cards.

Currently, business cards are supported in the English language only, and JPG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF files are supported. More languages and file formats will be added in the future.

You can use the Business card reader in your model-driven apps, canvas apps, and Power Automate flows. The Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise **Quick Create: Contact** and **Quick Create: Lead** forms also include the Business card reader, which you can use to automatically pre-fill the contact and lead information from the business card.
