Your goal for this exercise is to accelerate the process of creating an appointment by using information from business cards. Users will extract contact information from a business card and prefill the **Quick Create: Appointment** form with the contact information. 

You will build a model-driven Power App and use the Business card reader component for this exercise. For more information, see the [What are model-driven apps in Power Apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) and the [Use the business card reader in model-driven apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/business-card-reader-component-model-driven) documentation.
