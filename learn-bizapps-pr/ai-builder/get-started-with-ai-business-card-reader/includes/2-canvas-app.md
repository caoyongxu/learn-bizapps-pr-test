Your goal for this exercise is to take a picture or upload an existing photo from the file system and extract contact information that is present in the image. You will then build a canvas app in Power Apps and use the Business card reader component. 

For more information, see the [What are canvas apps in Power Apps?](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started/?azure-portal=true) and the [Use the Business card reader component in a canvas app](/ai-builder/business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps/?azure-portal=true) documentation.

### Create an application in Power Apps

To create an application in Power Apps, follow these steps:

1. Select **Create** in the Power Apps left menu and then select **Canvas app from blank**.
2. Name the canvas app **Contoso Business card reader**.
3. Select **Phone**.
4. Select **Create**.

### Enable automatic retrieval of contact information from business cards

Follow these steps to give users the ability to automatically retrieve contact information from business cards:

1. From the **Insert** menu and **AI Builder** bar, select **Business card reader**. This control will allow you to take or upload a picture and automatically recognize contact information from business cards.
2. Resize the control to fit the screen.

### Bind the contact information to an existing table from Microsoft Dataverse

To bind the contact information to an existing table from Dataverse, follow these steps:

1. Select **Insert a new Form in edition mode**.
2. Change the **Default mode** property to **New** and the **Data source** property to the **Contacts** table.
3. After the **Data Source** property has been set, three fields are automatically added to the form. Select the **Fields** property and add other contact fields to the form. Business card reader can extract 18 different fields from business cards. For this example, you will add the **Website** field.

### Bind the extracted contact information to the form

To bind the extracted contact information to the form, follow these steps:

1. Go to each of the form's data cards and, in the **Advanced** tab, select **Unlock to change properties**.

    ![Screenshot of the Advanced tab, with Unlock to change properties circled.](../media/image3.png)

2. You can now change the default value of each data card to map the Business card reader extracted properties. Set the following default values:

   - **Full Name_DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.FullName

   - **Email_DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.Email

   - **Business Phone_ DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.BusinessPhone

   - **Website_ DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.Website

You can always add more fields to be mapped. For this example, you can extract the following list of fields from your business cards.

4. To analyze a business card, select **Scan business card** and then select an image that you have saved. You can also use your mobile device to take a picture.

AI Builder Business card reader will process the business card and display extracted contact information.

The extracted contact information is now displayed in the form's data cards. You can review it and create a new contact by selecting **Create contact**.

You can add new fields to the form; AI Builder Business card reader will recognize various contact information from business cards. You can also use the extracted information to create records in other tables from Dataverse and to use it in external data sources.

You have now learned how to build a Power Apps canvas app with the AI Builder Business card reader component, and have discovered how to use the extracted contact information to create a new record in the **Contact** table from Dataverse.
