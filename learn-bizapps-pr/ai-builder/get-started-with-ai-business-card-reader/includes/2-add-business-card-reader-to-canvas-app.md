In this unit, you will:
-   Create an app in Power Apps and add a Business Card Reader to it.
-   Consume the extracted contact information from business cards.

**You can now differentiate between included and premium features. In this unit, you learned that included features can be integrated without capacity, without time or volume limitation, for all actions.**

**Additionally, you discovered that premium features require capacity. Capacity is required at creation (for custom models) and is required and consumed when a model is used or, in some cases like Object Detection, when a model is trained. The amount of consumed capacity depends on the scenario.**
