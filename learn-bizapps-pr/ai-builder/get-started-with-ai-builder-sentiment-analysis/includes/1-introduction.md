Before you begin this course, we recommend that you read the **Get Started with AI Builder** module and the What is AI Builder? documentation.

### Introduction to AI Builder Sentiment analysis

AI Builder Sentiment analysis is a prebuilt AI model that identifies that the sentiment of the entered text is *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*. AI models usually require that you provide samples of data to train before being able to perform predictions. Prebuilt models are pre-trained with a set of samples from Microsoft, so they are ready to use right away.

AI Builder Sentiment analysis identifies the sentiment of the text by using [Azure Cognitive Services Text analytics](/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview/?azure-portal=true) technology. Refer to the Language and region support for the Text Analytics API documentation for supported languages.

You can choose from many possible business applications for sentiment analysis for your business.Â These applications are covered later in this module.

After the sentiment has been analyzed, a Power Apps and Power Automate maker can use this data in Power Apps and flows to inform and automate business processes.
