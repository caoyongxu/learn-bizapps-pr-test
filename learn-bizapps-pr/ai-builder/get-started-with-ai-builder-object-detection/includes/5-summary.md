Congratulations on creating your first Object detection model with AI Builder. 

In this module, you discovered the basics of the Object detection AI capability and how you can use a published model in Power Apps. 

Specifically, you learned that: 

-   Your model learns from the images that you use to train. 

-   The domain gives a hint to the Object detection AI capability to provide better accuracy.

-   An object detector component for canvas apps will allow you to extract objects from images and photos by using your model.
