Before you begin this course, we recommend that you first see the **Get Started with AI Builder** module and read the "What is AI Builder?" content.

AI Builder features are available through several Microsoft products, including Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint, which are referred to as base products. Users of these base products can access specific AI features that are part of AI Builder.

Accordingly, to gain access to AI Builder features, you first need to access the base Microsoft product, which requires a specific license. Refer to the documentation of each base product to learn about their licensing models.

Because AI Builder is not a base product, but rather a set of features that you add on to existing products, it is referred to as an add-on.

If you detect an AI Builder feature after you have accessed the base product by using your license, it could be one of two possibilities:

- The AI Builder feature is included in your license.

- The AI Builder feature is a premium feature that requires an add-on license.

If the feature is included, you don't need additional licensing; the base product license is enough.

This standard is true for all preview features that are available in Power Apps or Power Automate. If a feature is in *preview* release status, it is treated as an included feature. In other words, you don't need a trial license or premium license to access them; you only need a Power Apps or Power Automate license.

For premium features, you need an AI Builder license. This license allows you to access all AI Builder features, regardless of the base product in which this feature is embedded. Later, this module will describe the two types of AI Builder license: Trial and AI Builder add-on. It will also describe how each of the licenses is linked to a defined capacity.

Now that you have been introduced to AI Builder licensing, you are aware of the differences between the base product and AI Builder features. Additionally, you are able to differentiate between the base product licenses and how to access AI Builder features, which can be included or required in a specific AI Builder license.
