## UNIT 2: Choose an AI capability

This unit explores the AI capabilities that AI Builder has to offer.

AI capabilities are brought to your apps and flows by something called a
model. A model can be built and customized by you, or it can be a
prebuilt model that is ready to be used right away. Before we go into
the model creation process, let's take a look at the various model types
that are available.

### Choose a model 

AI Builder comes with a wide variety of models to enhance your apps and
business processes.

Sign into Power Apps or Power Automate and select **AI Builder > Build** in
the left-side menu.

Each tile represents a different AI capability that you can bring to
your business.

Select any tile.

### Learn about the model

Each AI Builder model has an introductory experience where you can learn
more about the model.

For those models that require customization, there's a summary of the
steps you need to take, as well as what you need to get started. There
are also examples of how you can use the model.

For prebuilt models, we've included best practices on how to use them,
and buttons you can select to get started using them right away.

### What's next?

In this next unit, we'll look at how models are created and managed.
