You can create a model in AI Builder by following a few simple steps.

## Select a model type

Sign in to Power Apps or Power Automate and select **AI Builder > Build** on the left menu.

The two classes of model are:

- Models that require customization before they can be used
- Models that are prebuilt and can be used right away

Prebuilt models have already been created for you and can be used right
away in your apps and flows. No prior work is needed to create the
model.

The following sections explore what you can do with the models that you customize.

Select the tile for one of the following model types:

-   Form processing

-   Object detection

-   Prediction

-   Text classification

Make sure that you have everything you need to create your model, as listed
on the **Get started** tab. You can also use [sample
data](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/samples) to create any
of these models.

1. Enter a name for your model in the **Name this AI model** field.

2. Select **Create**.

## Follow the guided experience

To help create your model, AI Builder offers a guided experience that will walk
through each step of the experience.

Every model type has its own set of steps to create a model. You can
find these steps outlined in the left column to help guide you
through the model creation process. As you progress from step to step,
the left column will be updated to reflect your progress.

At any time during the creation process, you can save your work and come
back later. Select **Save and close** in the upper-right corner, next to
the name of your model. Progress is also saved automatically when you
go between steps.

Along the right column is a list of **Quick tips** that can help you
understand some of the concepts and actions that you need to take in the
current step. If you need more help, select the **Get help** link on the
**Get help or send feedback** tip card, where you can report an issue, send
feedback, and find documentation.

Follow the instructions on each page to advance to the next step.

The final step is a summary of the customizations that you made in the
previous steps. Review this information to be sure that every detail is
configured as intended, and then begin training your model. Training might
take a while depending on the size of your data.

After the training has been completed, your model is ready to be tested.
