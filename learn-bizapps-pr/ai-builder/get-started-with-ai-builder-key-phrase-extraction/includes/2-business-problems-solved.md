**Use case: Resource planning and trend analysis**

Use extracted key phrases from customer surveys for resource planning and trend analysis.

**Example:** 

Incoming customer survey feedback from digital forms or other channels can be sent to AIBuilder to detect the key phrases. The extracted key phrases can be saved in Dynamics CRM and then used to categorize the requests for resource planning and trend analysis.

### Use case: Support incident routing 

Use extracted key phrases to correctly route the support incidents to the right agents.

Example: A customer sends feedback that they are upset about not able to access their account and there is no notification about possible site maintenance. This event triggers a Power Automate flow to extract the key phrases. The extracted phrase is identified as account-related, and the flow then sends a notification to the account management team.

The account management team immediately responds to the customer with explanation of weekly site maintenance that lasts a couple of hours from 12AM-2AM, and that the account information will be available soon.

This automated routing of the issue reduces the time to respond back to the customer making it a better customer experience.

###  Use case: Employee morale and workplace health sentiment analysis 

Employee morale and workplace health are very important signals about the wellbeing of company. Key phrase extraction can be used to extract the key phrases from employee's survey comments to understand the key topics.

Example: An HR manager would like to better understand the employees' feedback about the new HR healthcare policy being considered by the company. She extracts the key phrases from the employee's comments in the survey. The AI model identifies the deductible for the policy as one of the top topics.

The manager sets up a conference call to go over the policy in detail with the employees before making the final decision.
