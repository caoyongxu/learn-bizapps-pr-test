-   Develop a simple flow with Power Automate that leverages AI Builder key phrase extraction

**Let's build a Power Automate flow that checks for key phrases in a message when you get a new message in a Yammer group. The sentiment is then sent as a push notification to our mobile flow app. See also [Create a flow in Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow))**

**The prerequisites are:**

-   **CDS (common data service)**

-   **Microsoft** **Excel**

**Create a flow that extracts key phrases**

Power Automate has connectors to many different services, including Yammer. Let's create a flow that automatically stores key phrases to an Excel file for each message that arrives in your Yammer group.

1.  Sign in to [Power Automate](https://ms.flow.microsoft.com/).

2.  Select **My flows**.
