For this exercise, you will develop a simple flow with Power Automate that uses AI Builder Key phrase extraction to check for key phrases whenever you receive a new message in a Yammer group. The sentiment is then sent as a push notification to your mobile flow app. For more information, see [Create a flow in Power Automate](/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow/?azure-portal=true).
