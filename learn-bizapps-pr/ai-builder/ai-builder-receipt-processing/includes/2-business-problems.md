Expense reports can be a very cumbersome and time-consuming task. Between all the manual data entry, approval workflows, and auditing, there are many pain points across the end-to-end process. With Receipt processing, you can minimize those pain points and increase the productivity of your employees, delivering real value back to your business.

Below are two sets of common business problems that can be solved with Receipt processing:

* **Travel and expenses (T&E)**\
    Travel and expenses, otherwise known as T&E, can represent a significant operational cost for businesses. Managing these expenses can also be quite difficult, requiring lots manual work and room for potential user error. Simply by uploading a receipt, you can extract the data from the receipt and instantly fill out the line items in expense reports. To take it one step further, you can automate the entire extraction process, scanning receipts as they are added to a central location, and even match them with credit card transactions.

* **Accounting and auditing**\
    Expense management is not important just for larger companies. Small business accounting, even your own personal accounting, can be streamlined by pre-populating expense reports with key information extracted from receipts. Then when it comes time for audits or reimbursement claims, you can easily assist auditors directly using the receipt values, or even detect for anomalies or fraud.

Building solutions with Receipt processing can save your business both time and money, and they can be very simple to implement.
