Exception and error handling in WinAutomation is divided into four levels:

- Level 1: Individual action exception handling
- Level 2: Exception handling for action blocks
- Level 3: Individual processes error handling
- Level 4: Global process error handling

Exception handling is applied within a process, to handle unexpected circumstances and prevent crashes. When the process cannot recover from an exception, an error occurs and the process is terminated. Levels 1 and 2 deal with exceptions within a process, while levels 3 and 4 set what happens when a process fails.
