  This module will show how to integrate AI builder into an existing API-based flow to facilitate a robust automated process.
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Build a new AI model for form processing
    - Train the new AI model to process Contoso Invoice forms
    - Integrate the new AI model into an existing Cloud flow
    - Perform a test run of the updated Cloud flow and associated AI builder-based predictions
prerequisites: The Target Audience should have a basic understanding of Microsoft Power Automate. This module builds off the modules Build your first Power Automate Desktop UI flow Use input and output parameters, Create a Gateway to Desktop UI flow, and Integration with Outlook connector.
