Robotic processing automation (RPA) helps you to reduce or eliminate burdensome and repetitive tasks by allowing programs such as Microsoft Power Automate to perform them for you. One way to make RPA exponentially more powerful is by using AI. Though it might seem intimidating to incorporate and train AI, Microsoft Power Platform simplifies those tasks to help make them easier for you.

In this module, you will:

- Build a new AI model for form processing.

- Train the new AI model to process Contoso Invoice forms.

- Integrate the new AI model into an existing cloud flow.

- Test the updated cloud flow and associated AI Builder-based predictions.
