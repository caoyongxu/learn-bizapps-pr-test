Robotic Processing Automation (RPA) allows you to reduce or eliminate burdensome and repetitive tasks by allowing programs such as Power Automate to perform them for you. One way to make RPA exponentially more powerful is by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although it may seem intimidating to incorporate and train AI, the Power Platform makes it simple and easy.

In this module, you'll:

- Build a new AI model for Form processing

- Train the new AI model to process Contoso Invoice forms

- Integrate the new AI model into an existing Cloud flow

- Perform a test run of the updated Cloud flow and associated AI builder-based predictions
