There are many models available from which to choose. Feel free to take a moment and read the descriptions to familiarize yourself with the various models. For this solution, we'll use **Form Processing**, which reads information from documents to pull out pertinent details. Choose the appropriate model to continue.

Name your model and select **Create**.
