This module uses an existing solution as a basis for creating the AI model. The solution includes a desktop flow that is built in Power Automate Desktop to perform actions in an invoicing application.

The desktop flow contains various input and output variables and is connected to a cloud flow via a gateway that is triggered by receiving an email in Outlook. All of this is packaged in a Solution in Power Automate. You can use this module to learn the concepts involved in creating and training AI models for your own solution, or you can build off the previous modules to recreate the example solution.
