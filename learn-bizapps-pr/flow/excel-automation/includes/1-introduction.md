Automating tasks related to storing and manipulating data in Excel is of critical importance for virtually any kind of business. 

Working with a large amount of data in Excel is quite common, especially in large organizations where Excel is used across multiple departments such as sales, accounting and human resources. Excel documents contain data in rows and columns, which is usually spread across multiple worksheets. 

Entering, processing and selecting data from an Excel document are algorithmic tasks, and are often performed manually. This means that there are a lot of potential scenarios and use cases for automating these tasks.

For example, letâ€™s say a company receives a list of customers in an Excel document. The document may be structured differently to the way the company keeps its records. Before the new list can be added to any kind of master file, the data must be restructured to match the structure of the master file. 

Thus, the Excel document must be read, the rows or columns must be shifted to match the format of the master file, and then the data must be copied to the master file ensuring no errors or loss of information. Such a task can easily be automated, to ensure that all updates to the master file occur without human intervention, and in an error-free way.

This module will demonstrate some of the most common uses of Excel Actions by developing Processes automating Excel-related business tasks.
