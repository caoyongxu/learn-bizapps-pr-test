The **Write to Excel Worksheet** action can write any static data or variable to a specified cell in an Excel worksheet. The action supports two writing modes:

- Write on a specified cell.
- Write on the currently active cell. To activate a particular cell, use the **Activate Cell in Excel Worksheet** action. 

If you set a data table as **Value to Write**, the specified or active cell will determine the cell for the table's upper-left element.

The **Write to Excel Worksheet** action accepts as input a previously defined Excel instance and doesn't return any outputs.
