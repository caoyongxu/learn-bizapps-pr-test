The Write to Excel Worksheet Action can write any static data or variable to a specified cell in an Excel document. 

If a datatable is to be set to be written, the specified cell in the Action will be the first (top left) cell of the table, and the remaining cells corresponding cells will be overwritten. Write Mode can also be set to **On Currently Active Cell**, as well.
