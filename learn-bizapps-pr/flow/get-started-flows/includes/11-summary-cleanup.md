Let's quickly review what we covered in this module.

In this module, you learned the basics of Power Automate, including the difference between triggers and actions and how to create flows for yourself or your team. You created a flow that automatically saves email attachments, scheduled flows and even troubleshot them.

## Next steps
Now that you're introduced to **Power Automate** the next step would be to take a look at a few scenarios where it is used more often. One of the most commonly used flows are approvals and using templates. 

Approvals help automate a request process which includes email notification. Also, **Power Automate** comes with hundreds of templates which is a great starting point to build your flow and then customize it to you match your need.

To learn more, see [Build approval flows with Power Automate](/learn/modules/build-approval-flows/?azure-portal=true) and [Use Power Automate to increase productivity](/learn/modules/use-power-automate-increase-productivity/?azure-portal=true).

**Congratulations!** You've finished the first module of this learning path for Power Automate. Continue learning by checking out the next module in this learning path.
