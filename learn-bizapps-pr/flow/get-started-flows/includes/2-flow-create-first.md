In this unit, you'll learn more about Power Automate as you build your first flow.

Since it can be time consuming to search for attachments in your emails, creating a flow can save you time by storing all your email attachments in a folder in your Microsoft OneDrive for Business account.

If you would like to see the process of creating flows, watch the following video.

## Important concepts in Power Automate

Keep these concepts in mind when building flows:

- Every flow has two main parts: a *trigger*, and one or more *actions*.
- You can think of the trigger as the starting action for the flow. The trigger can be something like a new email arriving in your inbox or a new item being added to a list in Microsoft Lists.
- Actions are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked. For example, the new email trigger will start the action of creating a new file on OneDrive for Business. Other examples of actions include sending an email, posting a tweet, and starting an approval.

These concepts will come into play later, when you build your own flows from scratch. In the next unit, we'll look at the Power Automate mobile app and its capabilities.
