title: Build Your First Power Automate Desktop flow
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  This module will focus on introducing the basics of Desktop flows and building the first flow to easily automate a repetitive task. 
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Become familiar with the Desktop flow.
    - Learn to create a new Desktop flow.
    - Record actions performed in the desktop-based Contoso invoicing application.
    - Perform a test run of the new Desktop flow.
prerequisites: The Target Audience should have a basic understanding of Microsoft Power Automate. As you will be recording actions performed in your UI in this lab, you will have the best experience if you view the lab instructions on a separate device or in a printout. You can still complete the lab while perusing the instructions during UI action recording, but you will have to perform extra work to cut the recorded actions of viewing the instructions from the desktop flow.
