You have now downloaded all the appropriate software and have the necessary licenses to create your first desktop flow, but first, let's get more familiar with the software.

Open up Power Automate Desktop and take a look around. In the upper right corner, you can see which environment you are in. Take a moment to make sure this is the same environment that you created a database for earlier. Under Flows you can see any existing desktop flows you have and edit, start, or delete them. Let's explore what it looks like when you are creating or editing a flow by clicking the **New Flow** button in the top-left corner.

Name your flow and select **Create**. Don't worry about the name; this is just to familiarize yourself with the app and you will delete this flow shortly.

After you have created your new test flow, you will see the Power Automate Desktop designer. There are several elements to focus on here, so let's go through them.

-   A. The toolbar - Contains basic operations for use with actions (Save, Undo, Copy, Debug, and Paste) as well as buttons to start the Desktop/Web Recorders and control the process execution (Start/Pause/Stop).

-   B. Subflows - Allows you to create subflows under your main flow.

-   C. Actions pane - Contains all Power Automate Desktop Actions and includes a search bar that helps finding specific actions by matching the action name to the text string.

-   D. Workspace - Contains all the actions added to the process so far. Functions are separated into tabs.

-   E. Input/output variables - Contains all the variables you created in the process.

-   F. Flow variables - List of all variables used in the process.

Save your flow and close the window. You can see your new flow in the list and by clicking the ellipses, you can expand the options for that flow and delete it.
