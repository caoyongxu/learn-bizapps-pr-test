Now you have learned how to reduce or eliminate repetitive and mundane tasks, increasing productivity. Robotic Process Automation allows you to outsource those tasks to easy-to-use software, freeing your time for more important or creative endeavors. Power Automate allows you to build automations on desktop applications without requiring custom connectors using Desktop flows. Desktop flows are the first step in designing your complete RPA solution.

In this module, you have:
