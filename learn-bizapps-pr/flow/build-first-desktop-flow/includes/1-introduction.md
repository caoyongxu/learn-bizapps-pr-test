Repetitive tasks consume many workers' days, decreasing productivity and creating a less-engaging work environment. Robotic process automation (RPA) allows you to outsource those tasks to user-friendly software, freeing your time for more important or creative endeavors. Microsoft Power Automate allows you to build that automation from start to finish by using Power Automate Desktop flows. Building desktop flows is the first step in designing your RPA solution.

In this module, you will:

-   Learn about Power Automate Desktop flows.

-   Create a new desktop flow.

-   Record actions that are performed in a desktop-based application.

-   Perform a test run of the new desktop flow.
