Repetitive and mundane tasks consume many workers' days, decreasing productivity and making work less engaging. Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, allows you to outsource those tasks to easy-to-use software, freeing your time for more important or creative endeavors. Power Automate allows you to build that automation from start to finish using Desktop flows. Here you will learn to build Desktop flows as the first step in designing your RPA solution.

In this module, you will:

-   Become familiar with the Desktop flow

-   Create a new Desktop flow

-   Record actions performed in a desktop- based application

-   Perform a test run of the new Desktop flow
