Organizations are built on data. Without information, companies are making decisions in the dark, but having and even organizing the data isn't enough. Data requires action within organizations.

In this module, you will:

- Build flows with Dataverse

- Integrate Dataverse with Outlook

- Integrate Dataverse with To-Do
