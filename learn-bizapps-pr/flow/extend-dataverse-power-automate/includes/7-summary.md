Organizations are built on data, and now you know how to use that data and how to effectively act on it through a simple and automatic process. You can use the concepts that you've learned in this module to automate your own processes and integrate Dataverse with other services by using Power Automate to make the already powerful technology go even further.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Build flows with Dataverse.

- Integrate Dataverse with Microsoft Outlook.

- Integrate Dataverse with Microsoft To Do.

## Key takeaways

Three key takeaways for this module are:

- Dataverse can go even further if you use Power Automate to create flows that connect your data to other services.

- Power Automate can connect hundreds of different services including Dataverse, Outlook, Microsoft To Do, and many more.

- Using triggers and actions that are connected to Dataverse allows you to disperse and use that information elsewhere.
