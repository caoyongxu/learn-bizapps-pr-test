In some cases, web pages and applications require physical clicks or keystrokes to perform certain operations. By utilizing "Mouse and Keyboard" actions, a process can simulate the use of a mouse and keyboard to automate such tasks.

Handling mouse and keyboard provides an alternative when automating tasks in software that doesn't support UI and Web actions for security, or other reasons. This adjustability allows businesses to automate any application, even if it is not entirely compatible with other automation actions.

To that end, WinAutomation offers a variety of actions that enable the simulation of mouse and keyboard operations like cursor movements, mouse clicks, and keyboard typing.

In this course, we are going to examine the functionality of the "Mouse and Keyboard" actions by developing Processes where this solution is applicable.
