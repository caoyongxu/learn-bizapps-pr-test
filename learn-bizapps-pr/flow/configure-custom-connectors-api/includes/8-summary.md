This module explored how authentication works to create a connection by using a custom connector and the connector that is authenticating to the underlying API. Custom connectors provide a flexible framework for supporting different types of API authentication. When you configure authentication for a custom connector, the connector runtime manages the authentication process.

You can share custom connectors with other users so that they can create a connection and use the connectors. Depending on how connectors are shared and the type of API authentication that is used, connections can be shared or users can get their own connection instance. Using solutions to copy custom connectors and connection references between environments and organizations provides more flexibility and control over the simple connection sharing.
