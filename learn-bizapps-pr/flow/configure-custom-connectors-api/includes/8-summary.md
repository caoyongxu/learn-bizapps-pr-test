This module explored how authentication works to create a connection using a custom connector and the connector authenticating to the underlying API. Custom connectors provide a flexible framework for supporting different types of API authentication. When you configure authentication for a custom connector, the connector runtime manages the authentication process.

You can share custom connectors with other users so they can create a connection and use the connectors. Depending on how connectors are shared, and the type of API authentication used, connections can be shared, or users must get their own connection instance. Using solutions to copy custom connectors and connection references between environments and organizations provides additional flexibility and control over the simple connection sharing.
