  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You have created a custom connector and would like another user in the same environment to be able to use it to create a Power Automate flow. What do you need to do to allow this to happen?
    choices: 
    - content: Save as on the custom connector to create a copy for the other user.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Sharing the custom connector would allow the other user to use it without having to take a copy.
    - content: Share the custom connector with the other user.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: By default, custom connectors aren't available to other users and you must share them to make them available to other users.
    - content: Change the authentication type to anonymous.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The authentication type does not have any bearing on whether another user can use the connector. By default, connectors aren't available to other users you have to share them directly so that they can create a connection and build apps or a flow.
    - content: Add connector to a solution and publish it.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Connectors can be included as a component of a solution. However, they still need to be shared to be available to the other users.
  - content: Which authentication scheme is recommended to secure custom connectors to the API deployed using Azure Functions?
    choices: 
    - content: No authentication
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No authentication scheme allows any anonymous user to use custom connector.
    - content: Basic
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Basic authentication is a valid authentication scheme but it is not a recommended one to use within Azure Active Directory environment.
    - content: Azure Active Directory OAuth 2.0 identity provider
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: OAuth 2.0 authentication scheme with Azure AD provider is the recommended security scheme.
    - content: Windows
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Windows authentication is only available for custom connectors using on-premises connector.
  - content: Which of the following authentication types are not supported by custom connectors?
    choices: 
    - content: Basic
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Basic authentication is supported by customer connectors.
    - content: Cookies
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Cookies authentication is not supported by custom connectors.
    - content: API Key
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: API key authentication is supported by customer connectors.
    - content: OAuth 2.0
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: OAuth 2.0 authentication is supported by customer connectors.
  - content: When configuring OAuth 2.0 authentication for a custom connector, which of the following properties must be retrieved from the API identity provider to complete the security configuration?
    choices: 
    - content: API Key
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An API key is only required when you are using API authentication for the custom connector. You must have a client ID and client secret from the identity provider of the API you're using in order to configure a custom connector for OAuth 2.0.
    - content: Client ID and client secret.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: The client ID and client secret are provided when the app for custom connector is registered with the identity provider. They are required to configure a custom connector to use OAuth 2.0 authentication.
    - content: User and password
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This is only required for basic authentication. You must have a client ID and client secret from the identity provider of the API you're using in order to configure a custom connector for OAuth 2.0.
    - content: A public key
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You must have a client ID and client secret from the identity provider of the API you're using in order to configure a custom connector for OAuth 2.0.
