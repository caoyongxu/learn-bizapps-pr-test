Logs of each process run are in the Console, allowing users to keep track of every run, regardless of how it was started.

 The logs can be accessed through the **Logs** tab in the WinAutomation Console:
 

![logs](..\media\logs.png)

On the left, results can be filtered based on the processes whose run you wish to monitor. As can be seen in the main pane, information about the invocation of a process, its start, and end point are available.
