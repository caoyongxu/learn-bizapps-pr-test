# Logging and Auditing
Logs of each process execution are kept in the Console, allowing users to keep track of every execution, regardless of how it was started.

 The logs can be accessed through the **Logs** tab in the WinAutomation Console:
 

![logs](..\media\logs.png)

On the left, results can be filtered based on the processes whose execution you wish to monitor. As can be seen in the main pane, information about the invocation of a process, its start and end point are available.
