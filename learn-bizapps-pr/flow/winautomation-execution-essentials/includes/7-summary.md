# Summary
Processes can be executed manually through the Console, by using the Start button.

They can also be assigned to schedules and triggers. This allows processes to run automatically, based on the date and time (schedules), or in response to certain events (triggers).

Processes are able to start other, independent processes during their execution, using the Start Process Action.

Processes may also be started through other applications, such as a command line interface – using the WinAutomation Controller – or Power Automate – using WinAutomation Actions within a UI Flow.
