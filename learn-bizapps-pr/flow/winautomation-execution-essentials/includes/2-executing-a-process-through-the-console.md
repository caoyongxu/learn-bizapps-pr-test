# Executing a Process through the Console
The simplest way to execute a process in WinAutomation is to manually start it through the WinAutomation Console. In the Processes tab of the Console, select the Process you wish to execute from the list, then press the **Start** button on the ribbon:
 

![process execution through console](..\media\process-execution-through-console.png)

When the process starts, the Notification Window will appear on the bottom right of the screen, keeping track of the execution:
 

![notification process running](..\media\notification-process-running.png)

The execution can be stopped at any time, either through the Notification Window, or the **Stop** button in the Console.
