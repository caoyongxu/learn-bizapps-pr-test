## Use the mobile app for flows
Of course we have an app! The Microsoft Mobile Flow app. From the mobile app, you can access these features: Activity Feed, Browsing, Buttons, and Managing Flows.

First, you’ll need to download and install the Microsoft Flow app from your app store.

Once it's installed, open it and sign in. When you open the app, you'll see the Activity Feed.

The Activity Feed is the spot to see what’s happening with your flows. It won't be the full experience you'd expect from your PC, but it will show you useful details.

For example, below you'll see the flow's last activity. You can see whether it succeeded or failed to run, and if it failed, which step it failed on.

When you click on the flow, you'll see that it succeeded in both steps. 


### How flows are started
   Buttons are flows that are started with a manual action. For example, you could create a button like Send a "Working from home today" email to your manager.
   You could use this one if you live far away and on days when the traffic is a mess!

- Select the **Buttons** icon to use some of these flows.

- Select the **Browse** button to check out templates for more button flows to add to your collection.

To see how to use buttons, we'll use the **Send myself a reminder in 10 minutes button** flow.

1. Select **Buttons**, then Browse templates.
2. Select the reminder button flow.
3. Select **Use this template**.
