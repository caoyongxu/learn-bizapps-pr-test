Building a **Power Automate** flow is the same as building any other
workflow. The physical button makes the process even easier because now
you simply click the button and the flow will run. You no longer need to
pick up your smart phone, open the Power Automate button flow, and then click
on the button. There are several scenarios where a physical button can
be used:

### Scenario 1: Record appointment time

Consider a field engineer arriving at the location. The field engineer
can click the physical button once to record the start time and then
click the button twice to record the end time. This helps the engineer
to record the total time it took to carry out the task.

### Scenario 2: Record travel time

Consider a consultant traveling to a client's location. The consultant
can click the button once to record the start time. The flow that it
kicks off will also record the departure location. The consultant then
clicks on the button twice after arriving at the destination which
records the end time and the destination location. Power Automate can
use both the time and the location to record the total travel time and
mileage.
