Power Automate physial buttons can make the process of running a
button flow efficeint with a click or double-click of a button on 
a mobile device. 

Using the Flic app and connector, we demonstrated how you can automate 
business processes so that a flow can perform tasks that provide information like 
start and end times of an appointment to your manager and others. Button flows 
can also be used to perform other tasks such as send emails or messages to 
notify others of your location.
