Power Automate physical buttons can make the process of running a button flow efficient with a tap or click of a button on a mobile device. This module used the Flic app and connector to demonstrate how you can automate business processes so that a flow can perform tasks that provide information like start and end times of an appointment to your manager and others. Button flows can also be used to perform other tasks such as sending emails or messages to notify others of your location.
