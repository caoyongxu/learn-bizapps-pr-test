This exercise uses an existing button template that matches your requirement.

For this example, you'll use the **Get today's weather forecast for my current location**
template that was previously created in this module.

Follow these steps to use an existing button template:

1. In your Microsoft Power Automate app, select the **Flows** icon on the lower part of the app and then select the **+** icon on the upper right.

1. A menu option will slide upward from the lower part of the app. Select the **Create from template** option.

1. Search for and select the **Get today's weather forecast for my current location** template.

1. Select **Use this template**.

1. Enter **Get today's weather forecast for my current location** as the flow name default.

1. Select **Create** on the upper right of the screen.

1. Select **Done** on the upper right of the screen.

1. Select the **Buttons** icon on the lower navigation menu.

1. Select the new button that you just created. The button name is **Get today's weather forecast for my current location**.

You will receive a notification on the top of the flow app that gives you a high and low temperature and the chance of rain in percentage format.
