Building a button flow is the same as building any other flow. You have
a start and an end. A flow always starts with a trigger action and in
this module, we are focusing on manually triggering a flow using buttons
without any input. After the trigger you add flow steps. Each step can be an
action or a condition or a combination of actions and conditions. The
flow always ends with an action.

There are two ways to design the process for a button flow, one is to
use an existing template with a button trigger and second is to build
one from blank.

### Existing template

Using an existing template is a great way to understand the basic
principles to design a successful flow.

To build one using an existing template:

1.  [Sign in to Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true). 

1.  On the left vertical navigation click on **Templates**.

1.  In the search bar on the top, type in **Buttons** in **Search
    templates...**

1.  You can then select any one of the templates that matches your
    requirements and then add all your connectors and fill in the
    required parameters.

Here is a screenshot of the button templates.

### Build one from blank

Building a flow from blank allows you the flexibility to design a
workflow that matches your customized logic that matches your
requirements.

To build one from blank:

1.  [Sign in to Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true). 

1.  On the left vertical menu click on **+ Create**.

1.  On the top you will see **Three ways to make a flow**. The first way
    is **Start from blank**. In that you will see **Instant flow**.
    Click on it.

1.  Give your flow a name and in the **Build an instant flow** you will
    see a **Manually trigger a flow** option to choose from. This is the
    option you select and click on **Create to build your flows from
    blank**.

1.  You then click **Create** to start building the flow.
