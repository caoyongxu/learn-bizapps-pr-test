In this module, you observed how an effective flow button can be
used to trigger flows that have no user input. In addition, you were
able to learn how to build the flows through the web interface and how to use the mobile
Power Automate app.

Finally, you were introduced to the Convert time zone action, which
was used to change the format of the date and time.
This action can also be used to change the time to match the zone.
