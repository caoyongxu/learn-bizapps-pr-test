In this module, you have seen how an effective flow button can be 
used to trigger flows that have no user input. In addition, we were 
able to build the flows via the web interface and using the mobile 
Power Automate app. 

Finally, you were introduced to the Convert time zone action, which 
in this case was used to easily change the format of the date and time. 
It can also be used to change the time to match the zone.
