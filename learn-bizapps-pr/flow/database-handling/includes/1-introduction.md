Databases are a vital part of every organization, and efficient data handling is necessary for their effective operation. Inserting, retrieving, and modifying data is fundamental for every information system.

Retrieving data from databases and using it in applications, is a common occurrence in enterprises. This behavior is achieved by combining business software databases.
