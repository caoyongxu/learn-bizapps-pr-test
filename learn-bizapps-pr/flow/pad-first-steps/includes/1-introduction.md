The Microsoft Power Automate for desktop platform consists of two main components that enable you to create and manage flows: the console and the flow designer.

The console is the main control panel of the platform from which you can launch the flow designer to create or edit flows. Through the console's options, you can also delete, rename, and run existing flows.

The flow designer is the development environment of Power Automate for desktop, where you can build flows and perform debugging. To develop a flow, you can drag and drop in the main workspace any of the available actions.
