When you launch Power Automate Desktop, the first window that appears on the screen is called console. The console is the main component of the platform from which you can manage your existing flows and launch the flow designer to edit them or create new ones.

Like all the products in Power Automate, the Power Automate Desktop console enables you to select a particular development environment, handle all the flows in it, and create new ones.

 > [!NOTE]
 > Environments are containers used to separate apps that might have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences.

To handle an existing flow, you have to make a right-click on it and choose between starting, editing, renaming, and deleting it. In case the flow is currently running, you have the additional option to stop it.

To run, stop or edit a flow more efficiently, you can use the icons next to its name.
