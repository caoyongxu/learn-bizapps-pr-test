Having business processes that are efficient, cost effective, and reliable is essential in today's business. Automated workflows allow you to do more with fewer manual tasks saving you time and money. Microsoft Power Automate in Dataverse for Teams automates workflows such as reacting to a new Teams message, emailing alerts when data changes in Dataverse, or performing scheduled tasks. With so much work happening in Microsoft Teams, automating business processes allow your users to be more productive.

To create flows in Dataverse for Teams, you need:

- A Microsoft Team with a Dataverse for Teams environment. A Team is provisioned the Dataverse for Teams environment when you create an app or bot in Microsoft Teams for the first time or install a Power Apps app from the app catalog. The Dataverse for Teams environment is used to store, manage, and share team-specific data, apps, and flows. Each team can have one environment, and all data, apps, bots, and flows created with the Power Apps app inside a team are available from that team's Dataverse for Teams database.

- The Power Apps for Teams app to create and edit flows for a Dataverse for Teams environment. Flows created in Power Automate for Teams or [https://flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true) are stored in the default environment and not in Dataverse for Teams.
