The type of workflows that can be created are categorized as automated and scheduled.

## Automated flows

Sometimes you have tasks that need to be performed when certain events happen. With Power Automate monitoring for those events, you can have the workflow automatically performed. Examples of Automated flows:

- When an item in a Teams list is modified, send an email

- Create a task in Planner based on an Office 365 Outlook calendar event

- Start an approval for new documents in Teams

## Scheduled flows

Scheduled flows are launched by time-based events. At a certain interval or a specified time, Power Automate will perform the workflow. Examples of Scheduled flows:

- Email a list of upcoming Calendar events

- Delete OneDrive files older than five days and send an email daily

- Send an Outlook email from a shared mailbox on a recurring basis
