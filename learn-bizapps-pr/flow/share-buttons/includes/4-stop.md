Let's look at how to stop sharing a button flow that was originally built by you.

1.  Log into your Power Automate mobile app and click on the **Buttons** icon available on the bottom horizontal menu.

1.  Click on the ellipses or the three dots next to the flow button and select **Invite Others**.

1.  You can now click on each of the users with whom the button has been shared. To stop sharing, you simply click on each of the users and then click on **Remove user**.

1.  Once you return, you will no longer see the user just removed from the Shared with list.
