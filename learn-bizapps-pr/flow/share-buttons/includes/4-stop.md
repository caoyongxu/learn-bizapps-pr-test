To stop sharing a button flow that was originally built by you, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to your Power Automate mobile app and then select the Buttons icon on the lower horizontal menu.

1.  Select the ellipsis (...) next to the flow button and then select **Invite Others**.

1.  Select each of the users with whom the button has been shared. To stop sharing, select each of the users and then select Remove user.

When you return to the button flow, you will no longer see the user(s) that you removed from the Shared with list.
