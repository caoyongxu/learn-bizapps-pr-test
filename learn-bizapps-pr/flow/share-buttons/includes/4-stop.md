Let's look at how to stop sharing a button flow that was originally built by you.

1.  Log into your Power Automate mobile app and click on the **Buttons** icon 
    on the bottom horizontal menu.

1.  Click on the ellipses or the three dots next to the flow button and 
    select **Invite Others**.

1.  Click on each of the users with whom the button has been shared. To stop 
    sharing, click on each of the users and then click **Remove user**.

Once you return to the button flow, you will no longer see the user(s) 
you just removed from the **Shared with** list.
