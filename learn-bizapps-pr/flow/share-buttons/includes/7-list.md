Only individuals with whom the button flow is shared can use the button flow. The button flow maker has the option to view the list of users with whom the button has been shared.

To find the list of users, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Power Automate mobile app and then select the Buttons icon on the lower horizontal menu.

1.  Select the ellipsis (\...) next to the flow button and then select Invite others.

1.  In the Shared with section, you will see the list of that button flow's users.
