Only individuals with whom the button flow is shared with can use
the button flow. The button flow maker has the option to view the 
list of users with whom the button has been shared. 

To find the list of users, follow these steps:

1.  Log into the Power Automate mobile app and click on the **Buttons** 
	icon on the bottom horizontal menu.

1.  Click on the ellipses or the three dots next to the flow button 
	and select **Invite others**.

1.  In the **Shared with** section, you will see the list of that button 
	flow's users.
