You have a Power Automate button that you've shared with one person, and now you'd like to share it with your entire team, which already has an Office 365 private group. You've been asked to use that private group to share the app with your entire team.

The high-level steps are as follows:

1. Confirm the name of your Office 365 Private Group.

1. Remove the existing user.

1. Add the new private group and confirm that people are using their own connections.

## Confirm the name of your Office 365 private group

For our example, the private group name we're using in this exercise is **Power Platform** and its email address is ```powerplatform@xyz.onmicrosoft.com```. You can find your group name in your Office 365 Outlook and use it for your example.

## Remove the existing user

1. Locate the Microsoft Power Automate button app you want to share.

1. Select the **Power Automate** option, which is available in the bottom horizontal navigation pane.

1. Select your **Late to work** flow and then select **Users and connections**. Below **Shared with**, you'll see any existing users. Select a name and then select **Remove user**. Repeat this step for any other users that you've listed there.

## Add the new private group and confirm that people are using their own connections

1. In **Users and connections**, select **Invite others**.

1. In **Search people or groups**, enter **Microsoft Power Platform** or your group name. You should see the name appear. Select the plus icon (**+**), and the group will be added. Select **Send** on the upper right.

1. A screen will appear that has a green check mark and states, **Button was shared successfully**. Select the **Manage connections** option.

1. In **Manage connections**, you should see both **Office 365 Outlook** and **Office 365 Users**. Select each **Edit** option that is located next to each connection, and then confirm that the **Provided by user** option has been selected. If the option is selected, then select **Cancel**; if it isn't, select the **Provided by user** option.

You've now successfully shared the button with an Office 365 private group.
