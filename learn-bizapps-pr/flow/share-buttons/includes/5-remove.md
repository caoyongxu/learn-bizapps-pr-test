You can remove a button flow that was shared with you. This process might be necessary because you no longer need to use the flow and want to remove it from your mobile device.

To remove a button flow, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Power Automate mobile app and then select the Buttons icon on the lower horizontal menu.

1.  Select the ellipsis (...) next to the flow button and then select Remove.

The shared button will no longer be available.

You can get the button back if the maker still has it shared with you. To get the button back, select the Buttons icon on the lower horizontal menu. Select Get more on the upper right of the app screen. You should see the button that you deleted.
