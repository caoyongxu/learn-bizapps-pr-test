Let's look and how you can remove a button flow that was shared with you.

1.  Log into your Power Automate mobile app and click on the **Buttons** icon available on the bottom horizontal menu.

1.  Click on the ellipses or the three dots next to the flow button and select **Remove**.

1.  Click on **Remove**.

1.  The shared button will no longer be available.

It is important to note that you can get the button back if the maker
has it shared with you. To get the button back, click on **Button**
icons available on the bottom of the horizontal menu. Then click on
**Get more** available on the top right. There you can see the button
you just deleted.
