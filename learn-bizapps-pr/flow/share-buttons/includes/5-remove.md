You can remove a button flow that was shared with you. This might
be necessary because you no longer need to use the flow and want 
to remove it from your mobile device. 

To remove a button flow, follow this steps:

1.  Log into the Power Automate mobile app and click on 
    the **Buttons** icon on the bottom horizontal menu.

1.  Click on the ellipses or the three dots next to the 
    flow button and select and click **Remove**.

1.  The shared button will no longer be available.

It is important to note that you can get the button back if the maker
still has it shared with you. To get the button back, click on the 
**Button** icons available on the bottom of the horizontal menu. 
Then click on **Get more** available on the top right of the app screen. 
There you should see the button that you just deleted.
