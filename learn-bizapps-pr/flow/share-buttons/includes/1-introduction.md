Microsoft Power Automate provides two options for you to share flows with
your colleagues. You can add your colleagues as either *co-owners* or
*run-only users*. Co-owners have full edit permissions for the flow,
whereas run-only users can only run the flow. 

You can add users as individuals, security groups, or Office 365 groups. 
The following sections explain how to share your button flows.

### Share button flows as a co-owner
To share your app with a co-owner, follow these steps:

1.  By using a computer browser, go to your 
    flow's **Share** option by selecting the ellipsis (**...**) next to 
    your flow in the **My flows** list. You can also go to your flow and 
    select the **Share** button on the upper portion of the button flow.

1.  Enter either the user or the group name and then select it.

    ![add user or group](../media/add-user-group.jpg)

1.  You will receive a message stating that owners of the flow will have full 
    access to all connections in the flow and the content within the 
    connected accounts. Select **OK**.

1.  Select the left arrow next to the flow name.

You have now successfully shared your button flow by adding a co-owner.

### Share button flows as a run-only user
To add run-only users, follow these steps:

1.  Select **Edit** in the **Run only users** section.

1.  Select either the username or the group name and then select which data 
    connector that the person should use. The person can either use the connection that you 
    created or a connector that they provided themselves. Select **Save**.

### Share button flows directly from your mobile app

    **Buttons** icon on the lower horizontal menu of the app.

    **Search people or groups** field.

### Verify that the user can access the shared button flow
To verify that the user can access the shared button flow, follow these steps:

1.  Have the user with whom you shared the button sign in to the 
    Power Automate app on their smart phone. Select the **Button** icon 
    on the lower horizontal menu.
