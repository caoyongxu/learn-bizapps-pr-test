    button and select **Share button link**.

    You will be provided with a few options to share the button link.

1.  Send the button link by using a text message. Select **Messages** 
    and, in the **To** field, add the phone number manually or find it by using 
    the address book on your device. The user whom you are sending the link to 
    needs to be part of your Office 365 tenant.

1.  When the receiving user opens the text message, the user's **Power Automate** 
    mobile app will automatically open and have access to the app. Depending on how 
    the flow was built, the user might need to approve the connectors.

You have now successfully shared a button link.
