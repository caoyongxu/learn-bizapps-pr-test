To monitor the run history of a button flow, you need to look at the flow
history. You can view a flow's history both from a computer browser or
the mobile Power Automate app. 

Both the flow name and the button name are the same. Let's look at how 
you can view the history from the Power Automate mobile app.

1.  Log into your Power Automate mobile app and click on the **Buttons** 
    icon on the bottom horizontal menu. Make a note of button name whose 
    flow history you would like to view.

1.  Next, click on the Flows icon which is also on the bottom horizontal 
    menu. Find the flow you want to view history for, and click on it.

1.  In the flow details section, locate and click on **Run history**.

Viewing the history for a flow can help you determine if people are having difficulty 
with your button flow, and possibly help troubleshoot any issues that user's are 
experiencing with your button flow.
