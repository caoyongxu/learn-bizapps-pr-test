Let's look and how you can share a button flow that has been shared with you.
Consider a scenario where a button flow was built by the maker, in this case 
Diego Sicillani, and was shared with another user, in this case Lee Gu. 

Now let's look at how Lee Gu is going to share with others.

1.  Log into the **Power Automate** mobile app and click on **Buttons** which 
    is available on the bottom horizontal menu.

1.  Click on the ellipses or the three dots next to the flow button and 
    select **Share button link**.

1.  There are a few options to share the button link. For our example, 
    let's click on **Mail** and share the app with another user who is 
    part of the same Office 365 tenant. In this case, we are sharing 
    the link with Pradeep who is the receiving user.

1.  When the receiving user, Pradeep, clicks on the text message, 
    the Power Automate mobile app will automatically open and he 
    will have access to the app. Depending on how the flow was 
    built, a user may need to approve the connectors.

You have now successfully shared the button link of a button flow
that was shared with you!
