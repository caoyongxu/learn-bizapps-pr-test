Power Automate Desktop allows users to handle Windows services through the services actions. With these actions, users can maintain full control of the operating system and limit the running services.

This group contains four actions:

- Start service
- Stop service
- Pause service
- Resume service

All actions of the group require the service name as input and don't return any output.
