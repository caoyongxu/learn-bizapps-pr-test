In this module, we discussed strategies that can be used to establish governance and change management processes. We also discussed that the governance tools that Microsoft provides can also be used for change management purposes. When makers are using Power Platform tools to improve their productivity, administrators should try to empower those users to help scale the organization.

The Admin Analytics feature, found in the Power Platform Admin Center, is a valuable tool for administrators to get insights into their users. This feature doesn’t require any intervention by an administrator, is refreshed automatically and retains data for 28 days.

For situations where administrators want more control, we highlighted many PowerShell Cmdlets that can be used to provide administrators with more visibility into their user’s actions. One benefit of using these cmdlets is that the data can be exported as CSV files, which means they can be loaded into an organization’s business intelligence tool. In addition to the tools that were just discussed, in Module 5 we are going to learn about how we can search Office 365 Security and Compliance logs, using a flow template, for Power Automate events. Using this flow, we can detect when there are new events, such as newly created flows.
