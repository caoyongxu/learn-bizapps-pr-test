Welcome to the Admin center! The Admin center is the central location where tenant admins and environment admins manage an organization's data policies and environments. Any changes that you make in the Admin center are immediately available to users in the organization.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Troubleshoot flows.
- Import and export flows.
- Share flows.
- Monitor flows.

## Environments

An *environment* is a space where you can store, manage, and share your organization's business data, apps, and flows. It also serves as a container to separate apps that might have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences.

The way that you use environments depends on your organization and the apps that you're trying to build. Here are some examples:

- You can create separate environments to group the test and production versions of your apps.
- You can create separate environments that correspond to specific teams or departments in your company. Each environment holds the relevant data and apps for each team/department.
- You can create separate environments for different global branches of your company.
- You can build all your apps in a single environment.

## Data policies

When you use Microsoft Flow, the data is automatically protected with whatever security roles your organization already has in place. It isn't possible to use Microsoft Flow to get access to information that the user doesn't already have access to in the organization. Some organizations may want to add an additional, optional layer of security that can proactively block flows that violate certain policies.
