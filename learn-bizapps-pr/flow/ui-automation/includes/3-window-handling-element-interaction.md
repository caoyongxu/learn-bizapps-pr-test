## Window handling

The **Windows** sub-group of actions is responsible with interacting with entire UI windows.

Use the **Focus Window** action to bring a window to the foreground; choose to identify the window by its control, then capture it, or use an already captured window control:

Similarly, add a **Set Window State** action to maximize the now focused application:

## Element interaction

Use the **Click element in window** action to perform a mouse click on a UI element:

> [!NOTE]
> This action requires a UI element control, in contrast to the previous ones which required a window control.

To edit the contents of a text field, use the appropriate action:

![Capturing a text field](../media/capturing-text-field.png)

Press the save button to save the changes, by using the **Press button in window** action:

Finally, use the **Close Window** action to close the app:
