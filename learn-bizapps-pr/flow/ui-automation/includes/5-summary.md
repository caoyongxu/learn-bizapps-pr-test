WinAutomation uses controls to interact with local application UIs and windows. This allows processes to identify UI elements without resorting to image recognition or absolute coordinates.

Controls may be added from the process designer's Controls repository, or directly from a relevant action's properties; they can then be used as input in **UI/Windows** actions.

UI/Windows actions interact with entire windows, or elements within them; such actions can be used to provide input to, extract data from, or manipulate various aspects of UI elements.
