WinAutomation uses controls to interact with local application UIs and windows. These controls allow processes to identify UI elements without the system having to resort to image recognition or absolute coordinates.

Controls can be added from the process designer's **Controls Repository** or directly from a relevant action's properties; they can then be used as input in UI/Windows actions.

UI/Windows actions interact with entire windows or elements within them. Such actions can be used to provide input to, extract data from, or manipulate various aspects of UI elements.
