Locally run applications, custom UIs, and the Windows interface often play an important part in automated tasks. Providing input to, extracting information from, or simply manipulating windows and the elements they contain, is an important part of automating most processes.

In this module, you will learn about the different ways to interact with windows and window elements. You will understand how to identify windows and elements, and manipulate them by providing input, receiving information, or altering their state.

By the end of this module, you will be able to deploy UI automation to identify UI elements, as well as to handle local applications and windows interfaces.
