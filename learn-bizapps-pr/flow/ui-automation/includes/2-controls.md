To interact with UI items, WinAutomation must first identify them. To do so without resorting to image recognition or on-screen positions, WinAutomation uses UI controls to identify windows and their elements.

## Add controls

When creating a process, you can add a control by selecting the **Add Control** button in the **Controls Repository**, as shown in the following screenshot.

Alternatively, when you are configuring a UI/Windows action, select the **Select Control from Repository** option and then select the **Add Control** button.

To capture a control, highlight it and then select **Ctrl + left-click**.
