  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Which of the following would not make running an unattended desktop flow simpler or more efficient?
    choices: 
    - content: Logging in and opening up all of the necessary programs before running the flow.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: An unattended desktop flow cannot be run if a user is logged in. 
    - content: Running the desktop flow on a virtual machine.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A virtual machine is a good option for running an unattended desktop flow, as it allows you to use your computer while the virtual machine does the work.
    - content: Using two different accounts to run unattended desktop flows on the same machine.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Using multiple accounts to create and run unattended desktop flows allows you to run more flows simultaneously on the same device.
    - content: Setting up a cluster of devices on which the flows can run.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Setting up a cluster of devices helps to prevent time out on your flows by allowing you to run multiple unattended desktops flows simultaneously.
  - content: Which of the following is true regarding unattended desktop flows?
    choices: 
    - content: Desktop flows can be queued indefinitely.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: If the queued flows exceed 3 hours, they will time out and produce an error.
    - content: Unattended flows can overload a computer.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Just like with any computer process, it is possible to give your computer more than it can handle with desktop flows. If your computer is struggling with the processes you are giving it, try setting up a cluster of devices to disperse the workload.
    - content: You cannot use a device that is actively running a desktop flow.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: If you are using a virtual machine, you can continue to use the device that the virtual machine has been set up on.
    - content: Actions within the flow have to be queued for specific times of the day.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: While it is good practice to queue flows for specific times of the day in certain cases, such as when queued flows are expected to exceed 3 hours, it is not required.
  - content: How does a cloud flow connect to a desktop flow?
    choices: 
    - content: Via API
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Cloud flows connect to other programs and services using an API.
    - content: Predefined input variables
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Input variables allow dynamic values for your desktop flows, but do not allow the cloud and desktop flows to connect.
    - content: Via virtual machine
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A virtual machine can run a desktop flow, but you still need a way to connect to the machine.
    - content: Via gateway
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: You need to define a gateway for every device or virtual machine on which the unattended flow will run.
