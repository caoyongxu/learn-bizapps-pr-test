A cloud flow runs in the cloud and accesses services through APIs. Cloud flows are required to trigger the unattended desktop flow. To begin creating your cloud flow, open [Power Automate](https://us.flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true) and select **My flows** and then **Cloud flows**.

Next, select **New flow > Instant cloud flow**.

Name your flow. The following screenshot shows the example name as **Manual trigger Desktop flow to enter invoice**. Select the **Manually trigger a flow** option and then select **Create**.

When the screen changes to the flow builder, select **New step** and then search for and select **Run a flow built with Power Automate desktop flow**.

If you haven't already configured your gateway connection, use the **Gateway name** drop-down menu to select the appropriate gateway.

If you can't find your gateway, you might need to delete this step and re-create it to refresh the list. If your gateway still doesn't appear, you might need to restart the gateway on your PC and then retry the process.

The next two fields request your credentials to sign in to your computer. If you're unsure what to put in the **Domain and username** field, you can open a command prompt window by opening the **Start** menu, entering **CMD** in the search box, and then pressing the **Enter** key. When the command prompt opens, enter **Set user** and then press the **Enter** key.

Several lines of code will appear. Separate the **user domain** and the **username** with a backslash (\), as shown in the following screenshot. Select **Create**.

When you've connected to your desktop, Power Automate will prompt you for information that is specific to your desktop flow. Use the drop-down menu to select the name of your flow, in this case **Invoicing**, and then select the **Unattended - Runs in the background without signing in** option in the **Run Mode** drop-down menu.

After you've selected your desktop flow, requested input variables will be added for you to fill in. You can use dynamic content from the trigger or other steps in your cloud flow to populate these variables. For the purposes of this module, you can enter placeholders because you're only testing the unattended flow. Select **Save**.

You've created the unattended desktop flow. Now, you can test it.
