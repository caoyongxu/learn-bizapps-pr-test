Robotic Process Automation (RPA) would be incomplete if someone had to always monitor the desktop flows and needed to be logged in and available for every interaction. There are some cases in which a process needs supervision, and those would work best with an attended flow, but some repetitive processes work as well without human oversight. For these, an unattended desktop flow is best.

In this module, you will:

-   Run a basic desktop flow in unattended mode

-   Run a desktop flow + cloud flow scenario in unattended mode

-   Learn best practices and set up for unattended desktop flows

This module uses an existing solution as a basis for running an unattended desktop flow. The solution includes a desktop flow built-in Power Automate Desktop to perform actions in an invoicing application. The desktop flow contains various input and output variables and is connected to a cloud flow via a gateway, which is triggered by receiving an email in Outlook and then uses a customize AI form processing model to analyze attachments and gain approval in Teams. All of this is packaged in a Solution in Power Automate. You can use this module to learn the concepts involved in creating unattended desktop flows for your own solution, or you can build off the previous modules to recreate the example solution.
