Robotic process automation (RPA) would be incomplete if someone needs to constantly monitor the desktop flows and must be signed in and available for every interaction. Occasionally, a process needs supervision, a situation that would work best with an attended flow; however, some repetitive processes work as well without human oversight. For those scenarios, an unattended desktop flow is best.

In this module, you will:

- Run a basic desktop flow in unattended mode.

- Run a desktop flow and cloud flow scenario in unattended mode.

- Learn best practices and setup for unattended desktop flows.

This module uses an existing solution as basis for running an unattended desktop flow. The solution includes a desktop flow that is built into Microsoft Power Automate Desktop to perform actions in an invoicing application. The desktop flow contains various input and output variables and is connected to a cloud flow through a gateway, which is triggered by receiving an email in Microsoft Outlook. Then, the flow uses a customized AI form processing model to analyze attachments and gain approval in Microsoft Teams. These features are packaged together in a Power Automate solution. You can use this module to learn the concepts that are involved in creating unattended desktop flows for your own solution, or you can build off the previous modules to re-create the example solution.
