Creating a desktop flow allows you to automate tasks that use legacy applications on your desktop. This reduces the number of repetitive and mundane tasks you perform daily and allows you to use your time for creative or strategic tasks instead. However, manually performing the trigger for your desktop application is nearly as bad as performing the actions yourself. Ideally, you will have an event from your typical work process to trigger the start of your desktop flow. You can accomplish this by building a cloud flow connected to a program such as Outlook to trigger your process.

In this module, you will:

-   Create a new Solution to package the end-to-end invoice processing solution

-   Create a new Cloud Flow that initiates the invoicing process via receipt of an email

-   Integrate an invoicing Desktop Flow into the new Cloud Flow

-   Perform a test run of the new Cloud Flow
