Creating a desktop flow allows you to automate tasks that use legacy applications on your desktop. This approach reduces the number of repetitive tasks that you perform daily and allows you to use your time for creative or strategic tasks instead. However, manually performing the trigger for your desktop application can be difficult. Ideally, you will have an event from your typical work process to trigger the start of your desktop flow. You can accomplish this task by building a cloud flow that is connected to a program, such as Microsoft Outlook, to trigger your process.

In this module, you will:

- Create a new solution to package the complete invoice processing solution.

- Create a new cloud flow that initiates the invoicing process through the receipt of an email.

- Integrate an invoicing desktop flow into a new cloud flow.

- Test the new cloud flow.
