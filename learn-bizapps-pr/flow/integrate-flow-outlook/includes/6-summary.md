Solutions allow you to combine multiple Cloud flows, desktop flows, and apps to automate an entire process and focus on the things that matter most. Now you know how to create a desktop flow allowing you to automate tasks that use legacy applications on your desktop and reduce the number of repetitive and mundane tasks you perform daily triggered by an event from your typical work process. You can accomplish this by building a cloud flow connected to a program such as Outlook.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

-   Create a new Solution to package the end-to-end invoice processing solution

-   Create a new Cloud Flow that initiates the invoicing process via receipt of an email

-   Integrate an invoicing Desktop Flow into the new Cloud Flow

-   Perform a test run of the new Cloud Flow

## Key takeaways

Here are the three key takeaways:

- Solutions allow you to group and organize multiple flows and apps.                                                                                

- You can export and import entire solutions instead of exporting individual apps and flows.                                                        

- Breaking your process into small steps and building and testing those individual steps will allow your RPA to be more robust and easier to build.
