In the previous module of this learning path, we introduced tenant and 
environment scopes when it comes to creating Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. 

DLP prerequisites follow a similar pattern, depending upon whether you're trying to set
an environment or tenant scoped DLP policy.

To establish an environment-wide DLP policy, the person creating the DLP
policy must be either an environment or tenant admin.

When creating a tenant-wide DLP policy, the person creating the DLP
policy must be a tenant admin.

For additional prerequisite information on managing DLP policies, refer to Microsoft's in-product
[documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/prevent-data-loss.md?azure-portal=true#managing-dlp-policies)for Power Automate.
