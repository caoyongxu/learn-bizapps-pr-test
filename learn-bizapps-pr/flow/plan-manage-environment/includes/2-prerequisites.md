The previous module of this learning path introduced tenant and 
environment scopes in regard to creating Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies.

DLP prerequisites follow a similar pattern, depending on whether you're trying to set
an environment or tenant-scoped DLP policy.

To establish an environment-wide DLP policy, the person who is creating the DLP
policy must be an environment or tenant admin.

When creating a tenant-wide DLP policy, the person who is creating the DLP
policy must be a tenant admin.

For additional prerequisite information on managing DLP policies, refer to Microsoft's in-product
[documentation](/power-automate/prevent-data-loss#managing-dlp-policies/?azure-portal=true) for Power Automate.
