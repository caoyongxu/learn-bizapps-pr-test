In this module we discussed many important governance tools and
processes that organizations can leverage to secure their environment.

The first area we discussed was establishing risk assessments and
mitigation paths. It is important to establish baselines and develop a
methodology to measure your current state against your baseline. If your
organization takes on too much risk, it could leave your organization in
a vulnerable situation.

We also discussed the need to accommodate exceptions. Due to the nature
of different business units, they may have legitimate business needs
that differ from other business units. It is important to be able to
accommodate these legitimate use cases, while still protecting the rest
of the organization.

Lastly, we discussed Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies in more depth
in this module. This included the ability to layer multiple DLP policies
within an environment. We then tested our DLP skills by creating a DLP
policy that supports Office 365 use cases.
