This module discussed many important governance tools and
processes that organizations can use to secure their environment.

The first topic discussed was establishing risk assessments and
mitigation paths. It is important to establish baselines and develop a
methodology to measure your current state against your baseline. If your
organization takes on too much risk, it could leave your organization in
a vulnerable situation.

Additionally, this module explained the need to accommodate exceptions. Due to the nature
of different business units, they might have legitimate business needs
that differ from other business units. It is important to be able to
accommodate these legitimate use cases while still protecting the rest
of the organization.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies were explained in more detail
in this module, including the ability to layer multiple DLP policies
within an environment. Then, you were able to test your DLP skills by creating a DLP
policy that supports Office 365 use cases.
