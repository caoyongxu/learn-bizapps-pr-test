In this module, we're going to discuss planning, which is essential in
securing and governing Power Automate environments. Since Power Automate
is a democratized automation tool that can be used by many different
people, teams, business units, and roles in an organization, minimizing
disruptions to those makers will ensure your organization remains
productive and that there isn't a disruption to business-critical
processes. Introducing governance changes after flows have been built,
may result in flows being broken which leads to unmet expectations.

If the Power Platform is new to your organization, now is the best
opportunity to get ahead before any potential impacts are introduced. If
your organization already uses the Power Platform, now is the time to
solidify a solid plan that allows you to be future-proofed and avoid
unnecessary disruptions in the future.
