In this module, we'll discuss planning, which is essential to secure 
and govern your Power Automate and Power Platform environment. Since 
Power Automate is a democratized automation tool that can be used by 
many different people, teams, business units, and roles in an organization, 
minimizing disruptions to those app makers will ensure your organization remains
productive and that there isn't a disruption to business-critical
processes. Introducing governance changes after flows have been built,
may result in those flows being broken which leads to unmet expectations.

If the Power Platform is new to your organization, now is the best
opportunity to get ahead before any potential impacts are introduced. If
your organization already uses the Power Platform, now is the time to
solidify a solid plan that allows you to be prepared for the future and avoid
unnecessary disruptions.
