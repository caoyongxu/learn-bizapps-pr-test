For many organizations, they have a general computing acceptable usage
policy that outlines permitted activities while using corporate
computing and network devices. Employees and contractors acknowledge the
policy and agree to use IT tools in the nature they were intended to be
used. Including statements that include Power Platform apps and flows is
a good opportunity to set expectations for the platform and users.

Education is another opportunity for organizations to share this
messaging. If an organization arranges for training sessions like
App/Flow in a day, these sessions represent the perfect opportunity to
go over ground rules about governance and expectations. Much like
organizations invest in cyber security training and exercises, like
phishing, it is important that organizations invest in educating makers
if they want them to use the Power Platform in a responsible manner.

Another opportunity to communicate policies is through automation. For
example, in Module 1 we discussed the Power Platform Center of
Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit. In this Starter Kit we discussed the
welcome email that can be sent when a new app or flow is created. This
provides an excellent opportunity for organizations to include policy
messaging and a link to an Intranet article that goes through it in more
detail.
