Many organizations have a general computing acceptable usage
policy that outlines permitted activities while employees are using corporate
computing and network devices. Employees and contractors acknowledge the
policy and agree to use IT tools in the nature that they were intended to be
used. Including statements that incorporate Power Platform apps and flows is
an excellent opportunity to set expectations for the platform and users.

Education is another opportunity for organizations to share this
messaging. If an organization arranges for training sessions for each
Power Platform product, these sessions represent the perfect 
opportunity to review ground rules about governance and expectations. 

Much like organizations that invest in cyber security training and exercises, like
phishing, it is equally important that organizations invest in educating the app makers
if they want them to use Power Platform in a responsible manner.

Another opportunity to communicate policies is through automation, such as the Power Platform Center of Excellence (COE) Starter Kit. 
This Starter Kit includes a welcome email that can be sent when 
a new app or flow is created. This email provides an excellent opportunity for 
organizations to include policy messaging and a link to an intranet article 
that goes through it in more detail.
