Many organizations have risk assessments that guide the organization in
establishing cyber security policies and managing risk through a
quantitative process. If your organization has an existing risk
assessment, it is advisable to first review that to see if it can be
leveraged. The last thing you want to do is create something for the
Power Platform that isn't aligned to a broader cyber security risk
assessment.

Otherwise, here are some considerations that can be used to establish a
lightweight risk assessment process that helps you track, measure and
monitor the risks within your organization.

### Establish baseline through standards

Clearly identify and articulate standards. If you want makers to comply with the expectations of the organization, then you need to identify what acceptable behaviors/actions/activities are. If people are not aware that these standards exist, they can't proactively comply with them. These standards should be made visible within an organization, through an intranet site or wiki. In addition, this information can be communicated through automation when a user creates their first flow, or app. We will further discuss this strategy later in this module.

### Implement governance controls to prevent unwanted actions

Much like speed limits, governance is only useful if it is enforced.
An organization needs to put in base rules/constraints in order to
avoid data leakage.

### Establish an exception process

There are bound to be situations where there is a legitimate
business need for a specific action/activity to be permitted.
However, it is important that the decision to proceed is captured
with the right level of visibility by people who have the authority
to make that decision.

### Track exceptions

Accumulating risks without being able to measure the organization's
overall exposure becomes an exercise of futility. By tracking
exceptions, quantifying their exposure, assigning accountability to
address risk and then reviewing risks regularly, an organization can
truly manage their risks and seek continuous improvement.

Some organizations have used the Power Platform to enable this
process. As we saw in Module 1, the Center of Excellence Starter Kit
includes the Developer Compliance Center that helps organizations
manage the deployment of new applications and seeks the makers of
these apps to justify the need for apps to exist.

### Regularly review and report exceptions

In order to drive the right behaviors, it is important to ensure
that risks are visible. If people don't feel that the risks have any
material impact, or repercussions, they won't feel that they need to
alter their behaviors. Having a very transparent view into the
organization's risks, allows management the right level of
visibility to assess whether or not they are comfortable with the
current state of risk within the organization.
