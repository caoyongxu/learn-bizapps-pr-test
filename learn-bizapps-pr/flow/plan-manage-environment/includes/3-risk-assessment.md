Many organizations have risk assessments that guide in
establishing cyber security policies and managing risk through a
quantitative process. If your organization has an existing risk
assessment, we recommend that you first review that assessment to see if it can be
used. One situation that you definitely should avoid is creating something for 
Power Platform that isn't aligned to a broader cyber security risk assessment.

Otherwise, the following sections highlight some considerations that you can use 
to establish a lightweight risk assessment process that helps you track, measure, 
and monitor the risks within your organization.

### Establish baseline through standards

Organizations should clearly identify and articulate standards. If you want makers 
to comply with the expectations of the organization, then you need to identify the 
acceptable behaviors, actions, and activities. If people are not aware that 
these standards exist, they can't proactively comply with them. These 
standards should be made visible within an organization through an intranet 
site or wiki. In addition, this information can be communicated through 
automation when a user creates their first flow or app. This strategy is further 
discussed later in this module.

### Implement governance controls to prevent unwanted actions

Governance is only useful if it is enforced. An organization needs to establish 
base rules and constraints to avoid data leakage.

### Establish an exception process

Situations might occur where a legitimate business need exists for a specific 
action or activity to be permitted. However, it is important that the decision 
to proceed is captured with the right level of visibility by people who have 
the authority to make that decision.

### Track exceptions

Accumulating risks without being able to measure the organization's
overall exposure becomes an exercise of futility. By tracking
exceptions, quantifying their exposure, assigning accountability to
address risk, and then reviewing risks regularly, an organization can
truly manage their risks and seek continuous improvement.

Some organizations have used Power Platform to enable this
process. As explained in the Introduction to Power Automate security 
and governance module, the Center of Excellence Starter Kit
includes the Developer Compliance Center, which helps organizations
manage the deployment of new applications and seeks the makers of
these apps to justify the need for apps to exist.

### Review and report exceptions regularly

To drive the right behaviors, it is important to ensure
that risks are visible. If people don't feel that the risks have any
material impact, or repercussions, they won't feel that they need to
alter their behaviors. Having a transparent view into the
organization's risks allows management the right level of
visibility to assess whether they are comfortable with the
current state of risk within the organization or not.
