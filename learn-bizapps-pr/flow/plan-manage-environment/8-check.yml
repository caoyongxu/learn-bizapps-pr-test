  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Using automation, what is the best way to communicate Power Platform policies?
    choices: 
    - content: Send makers an email when they have built their first flow or app using Power Platform Management connectors and Power Automate.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: There is no in-product experience to communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and the Power Planform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and sends them an email that includes policy information.
    - content: Display policy information in the Admin Analytics reports in the Power Platform Admin Center.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: There is no in-product experience to communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and the Power Planform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and sends them an email that includes policy information.
    - content: Display policy information in the Power Automate maker portal.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: There is no in-product experience to communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and the Power Planform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and sends them an email that includes policy information.
    - content: Update the terms and conditions statements in the Power Platform Admin Center.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: There is no in-product experience to communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and the Power Planform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and sends them an email that includes policy information.
  - content: Suppose we have two Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. Within policy #1 we have the **Microsoft Teams** connector and the **Office 365 Users** connector in the **Business data only** data group. In policy #2, we have the **SharePoint** and **Office 365 Groups** connectors in the **Business data only** data group. What happens if we try to create a flow that includes **Microsoft Teams** and **SharePoint** connectors within the same flow?
    choices: 
    - content: The flow is successfully saved and remains in an enabled state.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Since SharePoint and Microsoft Teams connectors appear in two different Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, they cannot be included within the same flow as it will conflict with DLP policies. The default behavior of DLP policy enforcement is that upon saving, DLP rules will be checked. If a flow violates a DLP policy, it will still be saved, but will be in a disabled state.
    - content: The flow is successfully saved, runs for 30 minutes and then is disabled.
      isCorrect: false

    - content: The flow is successfully saved, but is immediately disabled due to a DLP violation.
      isCorrect: true

The default behavior of DLP policy enforcement is that upon saving, DLP rules will be checked. If a flow violates a DLP policy, it will still be saved, but will be in a disabled state.
    - content: The flow is not successfully saved and the maker will lose all of their work.

What happens if we try to create a flow that includes **Common Data Service** and **Twitter** connectors within the same flow?
    choices: 
    - content: The flow is successfully saved and remains in an enabled state.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Since the Common Data Service and Twitter connectors have not been explicitly placed in the **Business data only** data groups in each DLP policy, it means that these connectors remain in the **No business data allowed** data group. When connectors exist in the same data group, a flow, or app, can be created that uses these connectors. In our scenario, since there is no policy that blocks using these connectors, we can still create a flow that uses connectors from the same data group, even if it is from the **No business data allowed** data group.
