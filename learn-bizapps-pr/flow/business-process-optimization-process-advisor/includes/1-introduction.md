Efficiency is the goal of all organizations. Completing a process in a faster and easier way with the same or better results is the dream, but it can be difficult to know where to begin when automating. Even with knowing the capabilities of technology such as Power Automate, defining a process is a difficult task, not to mention understanding the activities, which would be most useful or simple to automate. What would really make this easy is if you had a service, which just watched what you did and then wrote it all out for you, identified bottlenecks, and recommended automation solutions with a specific technology. This is exactly what Process Advisor can do for you!

Process Advisor works through Power Automate to record your actions on your desktop to map your process. With at least two recordings, Process Advisor will map your process and give you insights on actions that are taking long or have many variations and then give you automation recommendations. You can share your process with others in your company to gather more insights by capturing recordings of multiple people performing the same process to understand how they differ and where bottlenecks exist.

Mapping out your process and beginning automation to increase efficiency and make your life easier has become simple with Process Advisor, let's dive into how it works!
