Efficiency is the goal of all organizations. The goal is to complete a process in a faster and simpler way with the same or better results; however, knowing where to begin when automating a process can be difficult. Even if you know the capabilities of specific technology, such as Microsoft Power Automate, defining a process can be difficult, including knowing which activities are most useful or simplest to automate. The process advisor capability in Power Automate helps make that task easier by providing a service that observes your actions and then documents the process for you. Additionally, process advisor identifies bottlenecks and recommends automation solutions with a specific technology.

Process advisor works through Power Automate to record your actions on your desktop to map your process. Then, it will map your process and provide insights on actions that take too long or have too many variations, and then it will give you automation recommendations. With process advisor, you can share your process with others in your company to gather more insights by capturing recordings of multiple people who are performing the same process. This approach helps you to understand how they differ and where bottlenecks exist.

Process advisor maps your process and begins automation to help simplify your business processes and increase efficiency.
