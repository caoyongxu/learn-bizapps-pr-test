In this exercise, you'll create a flow that calculates how many overtime hours employees have worked. Consider that a typical working day is eight hours.

1. Launch Power Automate Desktop console and create a new flow named **Overtime calculator**.

1. Add a **Launch Excel** action to the workspace and configure it to launch an Excel file named **Employees.xlsx**.

1. Use the **Get first free column/row from Excel worksheet** action to find the first free row in the file.

1. Deploy a **Loop** and set it to iterate from the second row to the last populated row of the file. The first row contains the titles, so it isn't needed in this process.

1. Inside the loop, use a **Read from Excel worksheet** action to read the cell that contains the current employee's total working hours.

1. Deploy a **Run VBScript** action. In the **VBScript to run** field, populate the code shown in the following image. This code uses the modulo operator to calculate the rest of the operation as **total working hours / 8**.

1. The return value of the **Run VBScript** action is a text value. Use a **Convert text to number** action to convert it to a number.

1. Use a **Write to Excel worksheet** action to write the numerical value in the current row's third cell.

1. Outside the loop, add a **Close Excel** action to save and close the file.

1. Save the flow and then run it to test that every action works as expected.
