While developing flows, you might encounter scenarios that need the implementation of custom behavior. The most effective approach to handle these complex scenarios is through scripting.

Scripting allows you to develop blocks of code and simplify pieces of flows that usually require dozens of actions. For example, you might need to execute JavaScript code on loaded webpages to alter their functionality or appearance.

Power Automate for desktop enables you to automate complex scenarios using scripting actions that run scripts in VBScript, JavaScript, PowerShell, and Python.

Using scripts, you can avoid the development of complicated flows and enhance your workflow flexibility.
