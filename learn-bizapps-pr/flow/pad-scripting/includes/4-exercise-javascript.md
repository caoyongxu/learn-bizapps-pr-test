In this exercise, you'll create a flow that calculates the last day of the current month using JavaScript code.

1. Launch Power Automate Desktop console and create a new flow named **Last day of the month**.

1. Use a **Get current date and time** action to store the current date in a datetime variable.

1. Add two **Set variable** actions and initialize them with the month and year properties of the date, respectively.

1. Deploy a **Run JavaScript** action and populate it with the code shown in the following image. This action returns a text variable that contains the last day of the given month.

1. Add a **Parse text** action in the workspace and use the presented regular expression to remove the date's unnecessary parts.

1. Use a **Convert text to datetime** action to convert the parsed text into a datetime variable.

1. Reconvert the datetime value to text using the **Convert datetime to text** action. We are deploying this action to create a custom format of the date.

1. To display the final text variable that contains the last day of the month, use a **Display message** action.

1. Save the flow and then execute it. You can try different time zones to ensure that the flow can handle all possible scenarios.
