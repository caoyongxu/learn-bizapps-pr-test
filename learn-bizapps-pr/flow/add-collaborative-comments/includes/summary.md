Thisâ€¯module explored how you can use comments as part of your process to create and maintain cloud flows. You can associate comments with the trigger or any flow action steps. By adding comments, you can help your productivity and improve collaboration with others. You can collaborate with any flow co-owner by using an @mention in the comment or reply. If a non-owner needs help, you can @mention them as well. After you've approved the user as a co-owner, they'll be notified, and the flow will be shared with them so that they can reply. Comments are flexible, and you can implement repeatable patterns for how you want to use them for collaboration.
