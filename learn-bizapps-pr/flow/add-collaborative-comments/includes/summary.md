Thisâ€¯module explored how you can use comments as part of your process to create and maintain cloud flows. Comments can be associated with the trigger, or any flow action steps. By adding comments, you can help your productivity and improve collaboration with others. You can collaborate with any of the flow co-owners simply using an @ mention in the comment or reply. If a non-owner needs help, you can still @ mention them. Once you approve, they'll be notified, and the flow shared with them so they can reply. Comments are flexible, and you can implement repeatable patterns for how you use them to collaborate.
