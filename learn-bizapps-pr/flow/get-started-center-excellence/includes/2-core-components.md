## Import the solution

Importing the solution is a required installation process that helps ensure that all non-core components in the starter kit work. You'll need to create an environment in which to set up the CoE.

1.  Download the [CoE Starter Kit compressed file](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload).

	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> Extract the zip file after downloading and before moving on to the next step. The CoE Starter Kit compressed file contains all solution components and non-solution aware components that make up the CoE Starter Kit.
	> For more information, see [Set up core components](/power-platform/guidance/coe/setup-core-components).

1.  Create an environment in which to set up the CoE.

	1.  Go to Microsoft Power Platform admin center.
	
	1.  Select **Environments > + New**, and then enter a name, type, and purpose.
	
	1.  Select **Yes** for creating the database and then select **Next**.
	
	1.  Leave Sample apps and data set to **No**.
	
	1.  Select **Save**.

1.  Go to your new environment.

    1.  Go to make.powerapps.com.

    1.  Go to the environment that you created where the CoE solution will be hosted. The example in the following screenshot shows that you are importing to the environment named **Contoso CoE**.

	> [![Establish connections to activate your solution.](../media/import-solution-ssm.png)](../media/import-solution-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If you create a new connection, select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

1. Update environment variable values. The environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data that is specific to your organization or environment. As a result, you only need to set the value once for each environment, and it will be used in all necessary flows and apps in that environment. All flows in the solution depend on all environment variables that are being configured.

1. Configure the following variables for the core components solution and then select **Save**. (If you need to change the value of an environment variable after you import the solution, go to Update environment variables.)

1. Select **Import**.

The import can take up to 10 minutes to be completed.

## Activate the sync template flows

The flows with the prefix **Sync** are required for populating and cleaning up data in the Dataverse tables (Environment, Power Apps, Flow, Flow Action Detail, Connector, and Maker). The sync flows are used to write or delete data from the admin connectors to the Dataverse tables. These flows run on a schedule.

The first run of these will be long running. To avoid issues, enable the flows in an explicit order and repeat this order on each upgrade as well.

1.  Select the **Center of Excellence - Core Components** solution

1. Turn on **CLEANUP - Admin | Sync Template v2 (Check Deleted)**.

1.  Wait until it finishes before you turn on any other flows.

1.  Ensure that the Sync Template v2 flows are already turned on for the following object types: Apps, Connectors, Custom Connectors, Flows, Model Driven Apps, Power Virtual Agents, Robotic Process Automation.

1.  Turn on **Admin | Sync Template v2**. When it completes, turn it off again.

1.  The previous action will cause the flows for the objects that are listed in step 3 to run. Wait until all are complete.

1.  Turn on **Admin | Sync Template v2**.

1.  Turn on the rest of the flows that are listed in the solution.

## Configure the CoE Settings table

This section explains how to enter data in the CoE Settings table. This table will hold a single row of information that contains your logo, brand colors, and so on, that different applications will reference.

The following assets depend on the CoE Settings table:

- **Canvas apps** - The optional branding details (logo, brand colors) in all canvas apps are pulled from this table. Optional support and community channel links are also used.

- **Optional flows** - The optional branding details and support channel links are used in communication flows. You'll also configure links to canvas apps in the settings. (The main flow that syncs data to the resource tables doesn't depend on this setting configuration.)

To configure CoE settings:

1.  Go to make.powerapps.com, select **Apps**, and then open Microsoft Power Platform Admin View model-driven app in Play mode.

1.  On the left pane, select **Configure**.

1.  On the **Configure view** screen, select **+ New**.

1.  Provide values, as shown in the following table.

	|     Setting                           |     Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

1.  Select **Save**.

You don't need to add more records to the CoE Settings table. Any dependent components will always get values from the first record.

## Set up audit log sync

The Audit Log Sync flow connects to the Microsoft 365 audit log to gather telemetry data (unique users, launches) for apps. The CoE Starter Kit will work without this flow; however, usage information (app launches, unique users) in the Power BI dashboard will be blank.

## Set up the Power BI dashboard

The CoE Power BI dashboard provides a holistic view with visualizations and insights into resources in your tenant: environments, apps, Power Automate flows, connectors, connection references, makers, and audit logs. Telemetry from the audit log is stored from the moment you set up the CoE Starter Kit, so over time, you can look back and identify trends for longer than 28 days.

## Share apps with other admins

The core components solution doesn't contain apps for makers or users, only admin-specific apps. These components are designed to give admins better visibility and overview of resources and usage in their environments. None of the components are to be shared with makers or users.

The user account who uploaded the solution, and the environment admin of the environment the solution exists in, will have full access to the solution; however, you might want to share these apps with specific other users. For more information, see Share a canvas app in Power Apps.

## Wait for flows to finish

After the sync flows have finished running (depending on the number of environments and resources, this can take a few hours), you're ready to use the core components of the CoE Starter Kit.

To check the status of a flow:

1.  Select **Admin | Sync Template v2**, which will open a new tab on the **Flow detail** page.

1.  View Runs.

## Update environment variables

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You don't have to complete this step during setup, only when you need to change the value of an environment variable that you configured during import.
