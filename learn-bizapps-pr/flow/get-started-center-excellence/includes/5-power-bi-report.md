The Power BI dashboard of the CoE kit provides a holistic view with visualizations and insights into resources in your tenant: environments, apps, Power Automate flows, connectors, connection references, makers, and audit logs. Telemetry from the audit log is stored from the moment you set up the CoE Starter Kit, so over time, you can look back and identify trends for longer than 28 days.

The dashboard provides analytics and data for the following areas:

-   Monitor - Oversight of tenant resources

-   Govern - Drive actions through insights

-   Nurture - Learn about your community

The following video demonstrates how to connect the Power BI report.
