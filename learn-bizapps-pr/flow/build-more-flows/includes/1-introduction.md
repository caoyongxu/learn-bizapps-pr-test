In the previous module for Power Automate, you learned how to build some
basic flows that save email attachments and send you reminders from your phone.

skills. If you already have some experience, this module will tie concepts together
and hopefully help fill in the gaps.

Be more productive, automatically: that's what Power Automate is all about.

So, let's get started!
