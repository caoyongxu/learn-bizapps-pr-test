The recorder is used to assist users in the development of flows. Using a recorder, users can perform tasks manually, and Power Automate Desktop will automatically generate actions to mimic their behavior.

The recorder can be used to automate two different kinds of applications: 

- Windows and desktop applications
- Web pages and web applications 

When recording desktop applications, the recorder generates UI automation, mouse, and keyboard actions. Likewise, the recording of web applications generates web browser-related actions.

## Accessing and using the recorder

To record a flow, select **Recorder** in the toolbar of the flow designer.
