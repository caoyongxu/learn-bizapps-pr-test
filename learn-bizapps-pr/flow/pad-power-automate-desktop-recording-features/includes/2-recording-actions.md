The recorder is used to assist users in the development of flows. Using the recorder, users can perform tasks manually, and Power Automate for desktop will automatically generate actions to mimick their behavior.

The recorder can be used to automate two different kinds of applications: 

- Windows and desktop applications
- Web pages and web applications 

When recording desktop applications, the recorder generates UI automation, mouse, and keyboard actions. Likewise, the recording of web applications generates web browser-related actions. Both group of actions can be generated in the same recording session.

## Accessing and using the recorder

To record a flow, select **Recorder** in the toolbar of the flow designer.
