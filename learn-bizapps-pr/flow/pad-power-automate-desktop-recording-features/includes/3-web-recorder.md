Letâ€™s use the **web recorder** to automate a web-based flow. This flow includes logging into a web portal, configuring and generating a report, and logging out.

First, we will launch our browser of choice, and visit the web portal. Then, we may start the web recorder in the designer window, and attach it to the browser:

![web recorder instance selection continued](..\media\web-recorder-instance-selection-continued.png)

When the recorder window appears, we proceed with performing the task manually; first, enter the necessary credentials and press the **Login** button:
 
![live web recorder](..\media\live-web-recorder.png)

Notice that, as the fields are populated, the relevant actions are added to the preview. Any actions that the user performs outside the web browser are ignored.

After logging in, we will continue with our task, as usual; we press the **Reports** button:

![software solutions dashboard](..\media\software-solutions-dashboard.png)

Use the filters to view all paid entries, and generate the report:
 
![software solutions reports](..\media\software-solutions-reports.png)

Now the report is generated, we wish to extract certain columns of data. We will do so by right-clicking on the required data and selecting **Extract Element Value** and then clicking on the appropriate value:

![element extraction context menu](..\media\element-extraction-context-menu.png)

To extract the entire column, we will repeat this for the second element in the column as well; the entire column will automatically be extracted:

![element extraction context menu continued](..\media\element-extraction-context-menu-continued.png)

Now, simply extracting one element from another column, that column will also be extracted in its entirety, and our end result will be a table:

![element extraction](..\media\element-extraction.png)

![recorded actions continued](..\media\recorded-actions-continued.png)

When we have extracted all the required data, we log out of the web portal:

![software solutions logout](..\media\software-solutions-logout.png)

![final recorded actions](..\media\final-recorded-actions.png)

The **Logout** button has no description; if we so wish, we may click on it to assign it a name. All actions in the recorder window may be edited in the same way at any time:

![recorded actions description](..\media\recorded-actions-description.png)

Finally, we press the **Finish** button, to add all the automatically generated actions to our flow:
 
![recorder region workspace](..\media\recorder-region-workspace.png)

These actions are now no different from any others: they can be moved, edited, and deleted; other actions may be added to them, and so forth.
