The desktop and web recorders automatically interpret a userâ€™s actions and generate blocks of Power Automate Desktop actions that achieve the same result. The desktop recorder generates UI and Windows-related actions, while the web recorder automates interaction with a variety of web browsers.

Automatically generated actions may be viewed and edited, both during, and after the recording.
