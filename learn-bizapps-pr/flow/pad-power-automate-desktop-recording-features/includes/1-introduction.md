Automating business tasks is a unique task of its own, requiring users to manually add, arrange, and configure individual actions to achieve the required results. The recorder enables users to jumpstart the automation of a task by performing it, and allowing Power Automate for desktop to interpret it into actions.

Letâ€™s take a look at a common automation case. A considerable number of business tasks require the use of web portals: launching a web browser, navigating to the portal page, entering login credentials, and then proceeding to interact with the web page, are all steps that require a significant number of individual actions to automate. Using the recorder, these actions can be automatically generated and configured by Power Automate for desktop, with minimal effort by the user.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the recorder during development, and how to apply its functionality according to the nature of the task at hand.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to understand the functionality of the recorder, the tasks it can be used to automate, as well as the most efficient ways to deploy it.
