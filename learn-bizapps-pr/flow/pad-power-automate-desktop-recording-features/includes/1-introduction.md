Automating business tasks is a unique task of its own, requiring users to manually add, arrange, and configure individual actions to achieve the required results. The **desktop and web recorders** provide a way for users to jumpstart the automation of a manual task by performing it, and allowing power automate desktop to automatically interpret their actions into power automate desktop actions.

Letâ€™s take a look at a common automation case. A considerable number of business tasks require the use of web portals: launching a web browser, navigating to the portal page, entering login credentials, and then proceeding to interact with the web page, are all steps that require a significant number of individual actions to automate. Using the web recorder, these actions can be automatically generated and configured by Power Automate Desktop, with minimal effort by the user.

In this module, you will learn how to use recorders during development, and how to apply the different types of recorders according to the nature of the task at hand.

By the end of this module, you will be able to understand the functionality of the two recorders, the tasks they can be used to automate, as well as the most efficient ways to deploy them.
