Letâ€™s do a quick review of what we covered in this first module.

You learned how to create an approval flow that uses a SharePoint list, and then saw how to process the approval flow. You'll learn how to create a SharePoint list where people can suggest Twitter tweets that can later be approved and posted. 

See you in the next module!
