The core of every workflow that is built using Power Automate is data. The connection to talk to the data source in a secured manner is done using a connector. The most common data sources are tables, which you can use to retrieve and store information.

A SharePoint connector gives you the flexibility to talk to both online and on-premises lists or libraries to do a Create, Read, Update or Delete (CRUD) operation.

## Key features and capabilities

SharePoint Online is a popular connector for Power Automate because of its user-friendly features that allow you to create the tables, or lists, to store data and libraries to store documents. Below are the types of columns you can create in a SharePoint list or library.

Automate is built into every SharePoint list and library, which allows you to create flows.

Set a reminder already comes with the Arrival and Departure feature. These flows are used to remind you a specified number of days in advance of the date in the column.
