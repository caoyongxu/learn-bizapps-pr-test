## Send an email action with dynamic content from SharePoint

The SharePoint connector has a trigger for new items in Power Automate flows. The example for this module will start a workflow process when a new item for a travel reimbursement request has been submitted. Email notifications are sent by using Microsoft Outlook.

The following screenshot shows the list in Microsoft Lists with the column types for travel reimbursement. SharePoint automatically adds the **Created**, **Created By**, **Modified**, and **Modified By** columns.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the list in Microsoft Lists showing column types.](../media/3-1-columns.png)](../media/3-1-columns.png#lightbox)

The following screenshot shows the **Choice (menu to choose from)** column.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Settings > Edit Column dialog box with column type set to Choice (menu to choose from).](../media/3-2-edit-column.png)](../media/3-2-edit-column.png#lightbox)

Return to the **Travel Reimbursement** list and, from the ribbon, select **Integrate > Power Automate > Create a flow**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Travel Reimbursement list with Create a flow selected.](../media/3-3-create-flow.png)](../media/3-3-create-flow.png#lightbox)

On the right, in **Create a flow**, select the **Start approval when a new item is added** option.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of Create a flow with the Start approval when a new item is added option highlighted.](../media/3-4-start-approval.png)](../media/3-4-start-approval.png#lightbox)

Confirm the connection and then select **Continue**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Start approval when a new item is added dialog box with the Continue button highlighted.](../media/3-5-continue.png)](../media/3-5-continue.png#lightbox)

Change the flow title and **List Name** to **Travel Reimbursement**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the When a new item is created dialog box.](../media/3-6-travel-reimbursement.png)](../media/3-6-travel-reimbursement.png#lightbox)

Modify this template to get the manager information. To do so, drag the **Get my profile (V2)** action and then drop it below the trigger.

The following screenshot shows what the template looked like before you modified it.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the flow with an arrow from Get my profile to the spot to drop it.](../media/3-7-before.png)](../media/3-7-before.png#lightbox)

The following screenshot shows what the template looked like after you modified it.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the flow with Get my profile in its new location.](../media/3-8-after.png)](../media/3-8-after.png#lightbox)

Select the plus sign (**+**) and then select **Add an action**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Get my profile action with Add an action highlighted.](../media/3-9-add-action.png)](../media/3-9-add-action.png#lightbox)

Search for **get manager** and then select **Get manager (V2)**.

> [![Screenshot of the Choose an action dialog box with the Get manager (V2) action selected.](../media/3-91-get-manager.png)](../media/3-91-get-manager.png#lightbox)

In **Get manager (V2)**, select **User Principal Name**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Get manager (V2) action with Add dynamic content selected and User Principal Name highlighted.](../media/3-92-user-principal-name.png)](../media/3-92-user-principal-name.png#lightbox)

In the **Start an approval** action, for **Assigned To**, select **Add dynamic content** and then select **Mail** in **Get manager (V2)**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Start an approval action with Add dynamic content selected and Mail highlighted.](../media/3-93-start-approval.png)](../media/3-93-start-approval.png#lightbox)

Select **Flow checker** to confirm that no errors have occurred and then select **Save**.
