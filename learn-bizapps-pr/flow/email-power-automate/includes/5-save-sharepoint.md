Microsoft Power Automate provides tools to help you build flows that monitor incoming emails and then save its metadata to a SharePoint list and its attachment to a document library.

## Save metadata from emails to SharePoint lists

Microsoft Outlook has a trigger called **When a new email arrives**, which will be used for this unit's example to monitor incoming emails and save the following metadata to a SharePoint list: **To**, **From**, **Subject**, **Body Preview**, and **CC**. 

The data will only be captured if the subject contains the words "Monthly Report."

The following table provides an overview of the column types for the SharePoint list called **Incoming Emails**.

| **Column** | **Type** | **Required** | **Additional information** |
|------------|----------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Title | Single line of text | Yes |
| From | Single line of text | No |
| To | Single line of text | No |
| Importance | Single line of text | No |
| CC | Single line of text | No |
| Body Preview | Multiple lines of text | No | Enhanced rich text |
| Received time | Date and Time | No | Date and time format |
| Has Attachment | Single line of text | No |

The following screenshot shows the SharePoint list. SharePoint automatically adds the **Created**, **Created By**, **Modified**, and **Modified By** columns.

Go to [https://flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true). Select **Templates** and then enter **incoming emails** in the search box. Then, select the **Activity record for incoming emails in SharePoint with specific subject** template.

Select **Expand condition**.

In **Create item**, add the **Site Address** and **List Name** and then populate the fields by using **Dynamic content**. The fields are from **Get email**.

The flow will monitor the incoming emails to your inbox. If any emails contain the words "Monthly Report" in the **Subject** field, the metadata is captured and saved to the **Incoming Emails** SharePoint list.

## Save attachments from emails to SharePoint libraries

Microsoft Outlook has a trigger called **When a new email arrives**, which will be used for this unit's example to monitor incoming emails and save the attachments to a SharePoint document library. The trigger is watching to determine if the email has attachments and if it has been sent from a specific person with the words "Monthly Report" in the **Subject** field.

To create a new document library, select the **settings** gear icon and then select **Site contents**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Power Automate Test Site in SharePoint with Settings selected and Site contents highlighted.](../media/5-10-test-site.png)](../media/5-10-test-site.png#lightbox)

Select **+ New** and then select **Document library**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of SharePoint with the New menu expanded and the Document library option highlighted.](../media/5-11-new.png)](../media/5-11-new.png#lightbox)

In the **Create document library** dialog box, enter **Incoming Emails** in the **Name** field, and then select **Create**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Create document library dialog box.](../media/5-12-create-library.png)](../media/5-12-create-library.png#lightbox)

The following table provides an overview of the column types that you need to add for the library.

| **Column** | **Type** | **Required** | **Additional information** |
|------------|----------|--------------|----------------------------|
| From Name | Single line of text | No | |
| From Email | Single line of text | No | |

While you are in **Settings**, scroll to the bottom and select **All Documents** in the **Views** area.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the SharePoint Columns list with Views and All Documents highlighted.](../media/5-13-views.png)](../media/5-13-views.png#lightbox)

Select **File Size**, which is a built-in column that comes with document libraries. Select **OK**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the All Documents view with File Size selected.](../media/5-14-view-all.png)](../media/5-14-view-all.png#lightbox)

You now have a document library created. Next, go to [https://flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true), select **+ Create**, and then select **Automated cloud flow**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Create page with Automated cloud flow selected.](../media/5-15-create-automated.png)](../media/5-15-create-automated.png#lightbox)

Select **Skip**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Build an automated cloud flow dialog box with the Skip button highlighted.](../media/5-16-build.png)](../media/5-16-build.png#lightbox)

Name the flow **Incoming Emails**. In the search box, look for **outlook** and then select **When a new email arrives (V3)**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the flow with the name set to Incoming Emails, showing a search for outlook.](../media/5-17-incoming-outlook.png)](../media/5-17-incoming-outlook.png#lightbox)

Select **Show advanced options**.

> [![Screenshot of the When a new email arrives (V3) trigger with the Show advanced options command highlighted.](../media/5-18-advanced.png)](../media/5-18-advanced.png#lightbox)

Add the options to help monitor the incoming emails closely and only capture the attachments from those who match your criteria. This example is monitoring the **To**, **From**, **Include Attachments**, and **Subject Filter** fields.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the advanced options filled in.](../media/5-19-new-email-options.png)](../media/5-19-new-email-options.png#lightbox)

Select **+ Next** step. Search for **sharepoint** and then select **Create file**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Choose an action dialog box with Create file selected in the search results for SharePoint.](../media/5-20-choose-action.png)](../media/5-20-choose-action.png#lightbox)

Add the **Site Address** and **Folder Path**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Create file dialog box with Folder Path selected and Incoming Email highlighted.](../media/5-21-folder-path.png)](../media/5-21-folder-path.png#lightbox)

For **File Name**, select **Attachments Name**, and for **File Content**, select **Attachments Content**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Dynamic content for File Name with an arrow from Attachments Name to File Name and from Attachments Content to File Content.](../media/5-22-name-content.png)](../media/5-22-name-content.png#lightbox)

After you have completed the previous step, the **Create file** action will be added to **Apply to each** automatically. This result is optimal because it will make sure that all attachments from the email are uploaded to the SharePoint library.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Apply to each action with Create file added.](../media/5-23-apply-each.png)](../media/5-23-apply-each.png#lightbox)

Select **Add an action** again, search for **sharepoint**, and then select **Update file properties**.

In the **Update file properties** dialog box, add the information that is shown in the following screenshot.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Update file properties dialog box.](../media/5-24-update.png)](../media/5-24-update.png#lightbox)

Your task is complete. Make sure that you select **Flow checker** and then **Save**.

When Jo Costigan receives an email from Megan Bowen, it has an attachment. If the **Subject** field contains the words "monthly report," the attachments will be picked up by the flow automatically and then saved in the SharePoint library.
