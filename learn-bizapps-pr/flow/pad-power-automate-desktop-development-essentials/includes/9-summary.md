New flows are created through the Power Automate for desktop console, using the **New flow** button.

Development takes place in the flow designer. Actions are the basic building blocks of a flow, while variables are used to store data to be used as input or output in actions.

Actions are run sequentially; however, this sequence may be changed by certain actions, like **Conditionals** and **Loops**. Conditionals modify the flow's behavior based on certain conditions, while loops enable the repetition of certain actions.

Subflows can be used to organize and reuse parts of a flow more easily.

The flow designer allows users to extensively test and troubleshoot a flow during development.

UI elements and images can be used to enable interaction with third-party applications, web pages, or images on the monitor.

To deal with unexpected circumstances, exception handling rules can be set up in most actions' properties.
