The simplest way to run a process in WinAutomation is to manually start it through the WinAutomation console. In the Processes tab of the console, select the process you wish to run from the list, then select the **Start** button on the ribbon:

When the process starts, the Notification window will appear on the bottom right of the screen, keeping track of the running process.

The process can be stopped at any time, either through the Notification window, or the Stop button in the console.
