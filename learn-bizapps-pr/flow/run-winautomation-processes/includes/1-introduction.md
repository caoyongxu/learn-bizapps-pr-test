WinAutomation is an Robotic Process Automation solution that is capable of automating rules-based tasks, allowing users to work on more productive and value-adding tasks.

Automated processes, once developed, need to be made available for use in a way that is flexible and meets the needs of both the employees and the enterprise. Making sure that processes are run in a timely and orderly fashion is critical to maximizing efficiency.

In this module, you'll learn about the different ways in which processes can be run, and see how processes can be run automatically, as well as all the different means by which users may manually start one. You will also examine the information that is logged and saved when a process is run.

By the end of this module, you will be able to deploy developed processes, and select the optimal way to run them based on their function and requirements. You will also be able to access and interpret important information about processes that are currently running, or have run in the past.

## Learning Objectives

* Start a process manually through the console.
* Configure processes to run automatically.
* Start processes through command line, through other processes, and through Power Automate.
