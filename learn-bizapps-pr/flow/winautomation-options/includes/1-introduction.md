WinAutomation provides an extensive selection of options that enables you to configure the way the platform operates. All the platform\'s essential settings are located in the Options Tab, the last Tab of the Console menu.

The Options Tab consists of three subtabs:

1.  Settings

2.  Error Handling

3.  Account

Each Tab configures different features of the platform, such as Concurrency policy, Database operations, Error Handling, and Account management.
