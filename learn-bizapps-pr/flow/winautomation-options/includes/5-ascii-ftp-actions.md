When you use FTP actions to download or upload files, you can specify the transfer type to be ASCII, BINARY, or AUTO. 

If you select AUTO, WinAutomation will use a defined list of file types to determine whether the file will be transferred in ASCII or binary mode.

This list is also used by the Download Folders from FTP and Upload Folders to FTP actions to determine how to transfer the files contained into the folders.

To configure WinAutomation to treat a file type as ASCII: 

1.	Navigate to **Settings** and then select **FTP**.
