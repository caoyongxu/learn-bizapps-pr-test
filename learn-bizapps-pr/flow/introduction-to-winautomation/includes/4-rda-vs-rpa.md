In RDA, which stands for Robotic Desktop Automation, there is an agent installed on a machine that acts as –what is referred to as - a robot. This robot can assist the User with their tasks. It can interact with the User and ask for inputs or advice on how to proceed with running a Process. 

The User is also able to start processes that will run on the workstation.  

In RDA, the robot can function in Attended mode, meaning that it can work alongside and with the User or in Unattended mode meaning that it can run Processes in the User’s absence but still on the user’s behalf.

RPA, which stands for Robotic Process Automation, refers to a distributed Automation software that works as a human, and creates a virtual workforce of employees. In RPA, the Attended and Unattended mode in a human assisting and autonomous-self-reliant mode also exists.
