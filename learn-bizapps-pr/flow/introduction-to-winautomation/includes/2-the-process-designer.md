The heart of WinAutomation is the Process- a term used to describe any action, or series of actions in a task that is automated. For WinAutomation to execute a process on behalf of the user, it must be developed first. To begin, click the “New Process” button in the WinAutomation Console.  The Process Designer is the environment where the tasks are built, and users are able to view the complete steps in a process.

In the Process Designer, the user can develop automated tasks, test, debug and troubleshoot it before it is ready to be officially executed as a completed ready-to-run WinAutomation Process.
