Once development and debugging is done, the process is visible and ready for execution, directly from the WinAutomation Console.  Users are able to decide how to invoke and start this process, manually or automatically.

The simplest and most straightforward way to start the execution of a process is to do so manually. Just select the process and click on the Start button in the Console. However, WinAutomation also offers the ability to trigger a Process on the occurrence of a specific event, like the creation of a file in a folder. 

Additionally, a Process can be executed based on a Schedule that the user has set. A schedule is nothing more than a set of preconfigured times at which the Process will run.

When a Process runs, any events that need to be reported are shown under the Logs tab in the WinAutomation Console. Some of there events may be the start of the processâ€™ execution, or the failure of its completion due to an unexpected error.

The WinAutomation Console also contains the Options tab, where general WinAutomation settings can be configured. Here you can find licensing information, Error Handling behavior configuration, backup, maintenance and other settings.
