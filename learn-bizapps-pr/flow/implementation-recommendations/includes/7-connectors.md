While the existing DLP model does support Custom connectors, by default,
they do not show up in the DLP policy editor inside the Power Platform
Admin center. As we previously discussed, the default behavior for
custom connectors is that they are managed as part of the default data
group that you specify. However, the custom connectors will not appear
within the user interface in the Power Automate Admin center. There are
some additional actions that must be taken by an administrator in order
to have Custom connectors show up in DLP policies that includes either
of the following:

-   Power Platform Management connector

-   Power Apps and Power Automate PowerShell Cmdlets

Using PowerShell to add Custom connectors to a DLP policy is the
simplest way to manage custom connectors. In the exercise at the end of
this module, we will demonstrate how this can be done.
