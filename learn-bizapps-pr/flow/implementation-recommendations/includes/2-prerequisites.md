The introduction module of this learning path explained tenant 
and environment scopes in regard to creating Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 
policies. DLP prerequisites follow a similar pattern, depending on 
whether you are trying to set an environment or tenant-scoped DLP policy.

To establish an environment-wide DLP policy, the person who is creating the DLP
policy must be either an environment or tenant admin.

When creating a tenant-wide DLP policy, the person who is creating the DLP
policy must be a tenant admin.

For additional prerequisite information on managing DLP policies, 
refer to Microsoft's in-product
[documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/prevent-data-loss.md?azure-portal=true#managing-dlp-policies).
