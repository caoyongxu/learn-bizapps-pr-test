Organizations collect and manage critical data such as financial records or proprietary information that provides a competitive advantage. They can also have sensitive information such as credit card numbers, health records, social security numbers, and other types of personal identifiable information. As you build Microsoft Power Platform solutions and provide users access to this data, it can be disastrous if they inappropriately share the data with those who shouldn't have it. Organizations must have a way to identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive data. Using Data Loss Protection (DLP) policies in your Microsoft Power Platform environment will give you this ability.

Over the course of this module you will learn:

-   How DLP policies protect business and sensitive data from being leaked

-   DLP policy configurations for Microsoft 365 and Dynamics environments

-   Using Power Automate for directional data governance

-   How to manage HTTP and customer connectors

Every organization has different needs when it comes to governance. Approach the following sections as options and implement the solution that best aligns with your requirements.
