In this module we are going to provide some prescriptive guidance on how
organizations can govern their Power Platform environments. The areas we
are going to focus on include default data groups for Data Loss
Prevention (DLP) policies. We will also provide some sample DLP
configurations for targeting Office 365 and Dynamics 365 users. In
addition, we are going to explore some advanced scenarios that include
Custom connectors and managing DLP for HTTP connectors. As part of our
Custom connector and HTTP exploration, we will also discover some tools
available to us including the Power Platform Management connectors and
PowerShell Cmdlets.

It is also important to remember that every organization has different
needs when it comes to governance. Approach the following sections as
options and choose to implement the solution that best aligns with your
requirements.
