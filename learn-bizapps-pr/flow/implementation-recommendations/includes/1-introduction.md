In this module we will provide some prescriptive guidance on how
organizations can govern their Power Platform environments. The areas we
will focus on include default data groups for Data Loss
Prevention (DLP) policies. 

We will also provide some sample DLP configurations for targeting 
Office 365 and Dynamics 365 users. In addition, we are going to explore 
some more advanced scenarios that include Custom connectors and managing 
DLP for HTTP connectors. As part of our Custom connector and HTTP 
exploration, we will also discuss some tools available to us including 
the Power Platform Management connectors and PowerShell Cmdlets.

It is important to remember that every organization has different
needs when it comes to governance. Approach the following sections as
options and select to implement the solution that best aligns with your
requirements.
