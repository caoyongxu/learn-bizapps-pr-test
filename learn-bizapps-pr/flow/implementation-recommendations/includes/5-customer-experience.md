Another popular use case that organizations face when creating DLP
policies is supporting Dynamics 365 workloads. We recommend the following
configuration when you are addressing the needs of Dynamics 365 users.

| Connector name                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Common Data Service                  | The Common Data Service connector provides underlying platform access to Dynamics 365 data that is stored in Common Data Service entities. This connector is the older of the two Common Data Service connectors and should be used in the areas of personal automation.                                                                                                                           |
| Common Data Service (current environment) | This connector can dynamically infer the environment that it is in. It also has some Common Data Service solution-specific capabilities like calling AI Builder predict actions. Using this connector also simplifies deployment scenarios because the Common Data Service environment does not need to be reset every time a flow or app is deployed.                                                     |
| Dynamics 365                              | This connector has been deprecated in favor of Common Data Service connectors. However, by not including it in the **Business data only** data group, other users could use this connector to send data to **No Business data allowed** connectors. With this in mind, it is best to include this connector in your DLP policy, but it is not recommended for use. |
| Approvals                                 | This connector is used to facilitate approvals in Power Automate. It is technically a connector, so you need to consider it when implementing DLP policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Optional** - Depending on whether an organization uses these
tools or not, these connectors are often used to support digital
signatures for contracts that might be generated from Dynamics 365.

While the preceding connectors represent connectors that are related
to Dynamics 365 services, some other connectors exist that
administrators should consider including, even though they are not
directly related to Dynamics 365. In some circumstances, the following
connectors might be considered for general purposes, like Content
Conversion, while others are available to help protect the organization
through the automation of cyber security processes.

| Connector name             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Audience                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Content Conversion         | The Content Conversion connector allows makers to convert HTML markup to plain text. It is useful when you need to remove all HTML markup so that you can store the raw text in another system.                                                                                                                 | All makers                    |
| Microsoft Translator       | The Microsoft Translator connector allows a maker to detect languages, translate text, and convert text to speech.

By using the Microsoft Defender ATP, Cyber Security Analysts can automate actions such as isolating machines, performing investigation actions, removing application permissions, running antivirus scans, and much more. | Cyber Security Analyst        |

Again, you might wonder why Power Platform and security-related
connectors have been included in the preceding list. The reason is because 
automating workloads shouldn't be restricted to app makers. Administrators
and Cyber Security Analysts also have increasing demands on their time
and they should try to be as efficient as possible.

In regard to cyber security, you can't rely solely on
analysts querying logs 24 hours a day. By taking advantage of triggers
for these security services, alerts and notifications can be sent to
these teams where they can subsequently respond to emerging threats in
near or real time. 

For some organizations, getting buy-in from security teams to use the 
Power Platform might be challenging. However, when Cyber Security 
Analysts have seen that the benefits solve their needs, they tend to be more open 
to extending its use to other areas of the organization.
