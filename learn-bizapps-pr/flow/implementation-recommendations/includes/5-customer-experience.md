Another popular use case that organizations face when creating DLP policies is supporting Dynamics 365 workloads. The following connectors should be assigned to the Business data group to protect Dynamics 365 data from leaking.

|     Connector name                       |     Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Microsoft Dataverse                  |     The Microsoft   Dataverse connector provides underlying platform access to Dynamics 365 data   that is stored in Dataverse tables. This connector is the older of the two Microsoft   Dataverse connectors and should be used in the areas of personal automation.                                                                                |
|     Dataverse (current   environment)    |     This connector can   dynamically infer the environment that it is in. It also has some Dataverse   solution-specific capabilities like calling AI Builder predict actions. Using   this connector also simplifies deployment scenarios because the Dataverse   environment does not need to be reset every time a flow or app is deployed.        |
|     Dynamics 365                         |     This connector has   been deprecated in favor of Microsoft Dataverse connectors. However, by not   including it in the **Business** data group, other users could use this   connector to send data to **Non-Business** connectors. With this in mind,   it is best to include this connector in your DLP policy, but it is not   recommended for use.    |
|     Approvals                            |     This connector is used   to facilitate approvals in Power Automate. It is technically a connector, so   you need to consider it when implementing DLP policies.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
