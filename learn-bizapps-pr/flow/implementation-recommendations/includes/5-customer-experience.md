Another popular use case that organizations face when creating DLP
policies is supporting Dynamics 365 workloads. The following
configuration is recommended when addressing the needs of Dynamics 365
users.

| Connector Name                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Common Data Service (CDS)                 | The Common Data Service connector provides underlying platform access to Dynamics 365 data that is stored in CDS entities. This connector is the older of the two CDS connectors and should be used in the areas of personal automation.                                                                                                                           |
| Common Data Service (current environment) | This connector can dynamically infer the environment that it is in. It also has some CDS Solution specific capabilities like calling AI Builder predict actions. Using this connector also simplifies deployment scenarios as the CDS environment does not need to be reset every time a flow/app is deployed.                                                     |
| Dynamics 365                              | This connector has been deprecated in favor of the Common Data Service connectors. However, by not including it in the Business data only data group, it means that other users could use this connector to send data to No Business data allowed connectors. With this in mind, it is best to include this in your DLP policy, but it is not recommended for use. |
| Approvals                                 | This connector is used to facilitate approvals in Power Automate. It is technically a connector so it needs to be considered when implementing DLP policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Optional** - depending upon whether an organization uses these
tools. Often times these connectors are used to support digital
signatures for contracts that may be generated from Dynamics 365.

While the connectors that we just discussed represent connectors related
to Dynamics 365 services, there are some other connectors that
administrators should consider including, even though they are not
directly related to Dynamics 365. In some circumstances the following
connectors may be considered for general purposes, like Content
Conversion, others are available to help protect the organization
through the automation of cyber security processes.

| Connector Name             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Audience                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Content Conversion         | The Content Conversion connector allows makers to convert HTML markup to plain text. It is useful when you need to remove all of the HTML markup so that you can store the raw text in another system.                                                                                                                 | All Makers                    |
| Microsoft Translator       | The Microsoft Translator connector allows a maker to detect languages, translate text and convert text to speech. It does not pose data leakage risks, but may be very helpful in multi-national organizations.                                                                                                        | All Makers                    |

Using the Microsoft Defender ATP, Cyber Security Analysts can automate actions such as isolating machines, perform investigation actions, removing application permissions, running antivirus scans and much more. | Cyber Security Analyst        |

Once again, you might be asking why Power Platform and security related
connectors have been included in this list? The reason being that
automating workloads shouldn't be restricted to makers. Administrators
and Cyber Security Analyst also have increasing demands on their time
and they should also try to be as efficient as possible.

When it comes to Cyber Security, you can no longer rely solely on
analyst querying logs around the clock. By taking advantage of triggers
for theses security services, alerts and notifications can be sent to
these teams where they can subsequently respond to emerging threats, in
near real time. Also, for some organizations, getting buy-in from
security teams, to use the Power Platform, may be challenging. However,
once Cyber Security Analysts see the benefits, from solving their needs,
they tend to be more open to extending its use to other areas of the
organization.
