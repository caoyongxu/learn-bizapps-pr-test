This module reviewed the behavior of the default data group and
its impact on new and custom connectors that are deployed to an
environment. It also reviewed popular DLP configurations for
Office 365 and Dynamics 365 workloads and demonstrated how you can layer
additional governance on top of DLP policies.

You also learned about how to include HTTP triggers and actions within DLP policies
when you use the 2018-11-01 DLP schema version. Finally, you
learned how to use the Power Apps and Power Automate
PowerShell cmdlets to add a custom connector to an existing DLP policy.
