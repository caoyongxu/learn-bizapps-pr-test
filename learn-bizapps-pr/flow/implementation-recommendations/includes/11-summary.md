To protect critical data from being shared with those who should not have it, organizations need to identify, monitor, and automatically protect data. Using Data Loss Protection (DLP) policies manage which Microsoft Power Platform connectors can share data. Directional data governance allows you to detect and prevent connectors from sharing in the wrong direction.
Over the course of the module you learned:

- How to use DLP data groups to control data flows between connectors
- Recommended DLP policy settings for Microsoft 365 and Dynamics environments
- How to use Power Automate flows for directional data governance
- Managing HTTP and custom connectors
