Examine the business process flow that was created in the exercise for
the previous module, Create an immersive business process flow in Power 
Automate. Review the following screenshot and notice the visual
representation of the process flow and a form under the business process
flow called **General**, which contains only the **Name** and **Owner** fields.

If you want to add more fields to a form such as this, it would be beneficial. 
For example, if you want to record the amount of the invoice, you could record an 
autogenerated invoice number and then add general notes about the service that you 
completed for a customer.

Adding more fields and displaying them on a form that is associated 
with an immersive business process flow can be simple and quick. These flows are powerful, 
and you are only limited by your imagination and skill.
