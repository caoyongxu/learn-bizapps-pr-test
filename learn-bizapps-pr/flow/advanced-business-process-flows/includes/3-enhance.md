Let's revisit the Business Process Flow we created in the exercise for
Module 2. Study the screenshot below and you will note there is a visual
representation of the process flow and a form under the Business Process
Flow called "General" with only two fields - Name and Owner - see the
screenshot below.

Wouldn't it be great if you could add additional fields to form called
"General"? For example, you might want to record the amount of the
invoice, record an autogenerated invoice number, and add general notes
about the service you completed for a customer.

Luckily, it is very easy to add additional fields and display them on a
form associated with an Immersive Business Process and we will show you
how to do this within an exercise below. As you will soon learn,
Immersive Business Process flows are very powerful and you are only
limited by your imagination and skill. Let's get started.

We assume you have completed the exercise to create an
Immersive Business Process Flow in module 2 of this learning path. If
you have not, please return to module 2 and complete the exercise within
it prior to beginning the exercises below.
