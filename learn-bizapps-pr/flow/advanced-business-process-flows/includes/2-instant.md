Business process flows aren't the exclusive workflow automation option
that is available to an entity in Microsoft Dataverse. In fact, a single
business process flow can run against up to five entities in Common Data
Service. Dynamics 365 workflows are also supported as part of a business
process flow. This topic is beyond the scope of this learning path, but
if you are interested in this topic, you can learn more about Dynamics 365
workflows by selecting the related link in the summary unit of this module.

A third workflow automation, called instant flows, in Power Automate offers
a powerful capability that can supplement business process flows.

Microsoft Power Automate offers instant workflows that can run (trigger)
automatically based on a schedule, time, data value, or if a
record is added, selected, or modified. These workflows can work in
conjunction with a business process flow to gather approvals, copy data
from Dataverse to another data source, or trigger an email
notification to specific users to alert them that something has changed and
needs their attention. You can make instant flows that automatically
trigger based on a record that is created, deleted, or modified, or you can
make the flows run (trigger) by having a user select a button within a step in a stage.

Instant flows are made with Power Automate and they start with a single
trigger followed by a series of actions. The following figure shows an example of an instant flow
that sends an approval request to a user when a record in an entity in
Dataverse is modified. In the exercises at the end of this module, you'll create an
instant workflow in Power Automate and add it to your business process solution.

Business process flows work within Microsoft Power Platform and
many options are available, including instant flows and approval flows that
can run in concert with a business process flow.

Business process flows don't exclude the possibility of adding
more capabilities to the envisioned solution by using
additional components of Microsoft Power Platform like Power Apps, Power
Automate instant flows, or Power BI Dashboards. You can read more about
instant flows by selecting the related links in the summary unit within
this module.
