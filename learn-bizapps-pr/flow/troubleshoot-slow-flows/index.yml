title: Troubleshoot slow-running flows in Power Automate
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Integration of Power Automate flows and SharePoint has resulted in an exponential growth of flows that are triggered by adding, editing, or deleting Microsoft Lists or documents. Occasionally, flows fail or are stuck while running. Flows streamline repetitive tasks and paperless processes, so it's important to know how to troubleshoot failures and return flows to successful runs.
