title: Troubleshoot slow-running flows in Power Automate
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  With the deep integration of Power Automate flows and SharePoint available, there has been an exponential growth of flows running that are either triggered by adding, editing, or deleting SharePoint lists or documents. From time-to-time, flows fail or get stuck running. Flows streamline repetitive tasks and paperless processes so that you can focus your attention where it's needed most. So it's important to have an overview of how to troubleshoot the failure and bring them back to successful runs.
