Occasionally, scenarios occur where the flow runs successfully but you don't get the results that you intended because of the flow. These situations are when using the **Compose** and **Variable** actions helps.

## Compose action to view data created by a previous action

The **Compose** action constructs an arbitrary object from the user's input based on an action.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Choose an operation dialog box with search results for Compose.](../media/image-3.png)](../media/image-3.png#lightbox)

For example, you want to see the timestamp format that is generated by the **Manually trigger a flow** trigger. Consequently, you add the **Timestamp** dynamic content to the **Compose** action.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Compose action with the dynamic content Timestamp being selected for the Inputs box.](../media/image-4.png)](../media/image-4.png#lightbox)

You can rename the action to add some meaningful text.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the ellipsis button selected and the Rename option highlighted.](../media/image-5.png)](../media/image-5.png#lightbox)

Now, when you save and run this flow, the timestamp format will show, which isn't the desired outcome.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the flow with a Your flow ran successfully message and a raw date time output.](../media/image-6.png)](../media/image-6.png#lightbox)

You can now use the **formatDateTime** expression to get the format that you need.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Compose action to convert the timestamp format.](../media/image-7.png)](../media/image-7.png#lightbox)

## Variable action to view appended data

Consider a scenario where you want to send a single approval action to multiple users. The data is stored in a list in Microsoft Lists with a Title column, which is a single line of text, and approvers, which is a people and groups column. The approvers have a multiple selection option.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Settings > Edit Column dialog box with the Allow multiple selections option set to Yes and the Allow selection of option set to People only.](../media/image-8.png)](../media/image-8.png#lightbox)

To view all names of all approvers that have been selected, you will initialize a variable.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Choose an operation dialog box with Initialize variable selected.](../media/image-9.png)](../media/image-9.png#lightbox)

Assign the variable a name and then set it as type **String**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Initialize variable action with Type set to String.](../media/image-10.png)](../media/image-10.png#lightbox)

Search and select the **Append to string variable** action.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Choose an operation dialog box with Append to string variable selected.](../media/image-11.png)](../media/image-11.png#lightbox)

Now, you can append the email addresses of all approvers' emails.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Append to string variable dialog box with dynamic content Approvers Email selected for the value.](../media/image-12.png)](../media/image-12.png#lightbox)

This action will automatically count how many approvers have been added and then append them, one at a time, to the string variable.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Apply to each action showing three of three.](../media/image-13.png)](../media/image-13.png#lightbox)
