Scenarios do occur where all information that is provided in a document doesn't apply to your flow. Occasionally, you might not be able to filter data by using OData query or the **Do until** condition will need to run every minute. These scenarios will affect the overall performance of the flow, so it's important to monitor the flow analytics and determine if timeouts have occurred.

File size can directly affect overall flow performance; the larger the file size, the slower the flow will run.
