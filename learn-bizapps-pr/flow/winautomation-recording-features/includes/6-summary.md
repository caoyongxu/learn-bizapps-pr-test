The Macro and Web Recorders automatically interpret a Userâ€™s actions and generate blocks of WinAutomation Actions that achieve the same result. The Macro Recorder generates UI and Windows-related Actions, while the Web Recorder automates interaction with web browsers.

The Macro Recorder can be configured to generate actions based on either coordinates or controls; the Web Recorder is always based on controls, and works with a variety of browsers.

Automatically generated Actions may be viewed and edited, both during, and after the recording.
