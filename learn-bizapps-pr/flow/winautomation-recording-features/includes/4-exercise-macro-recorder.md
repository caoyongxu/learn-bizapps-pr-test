As we have seen so far, web browser-related tasks can also be automated using the Web Recorder; any other tasks, including input and output peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor) and the use of local applications, can be developed in a similar fashion using the Macro Recorder.

In this exercise, you will automate a desktop-related task, to get a better grasp of the Macro Recorder, and the capabilities that Recorders provide.
## Step 1
Create a new Process using the Process Designer.
## Step 2
Add a **Run Application** Action, configured as below:
 

![run application properties exercise](..\media\run-application-properties-exercise.png)

## Step 3
Run the Process to launch Excel.
## Step 4
Click on the Macro Recorder button in the Designer:
 

![macro recorder button exercise](..\media\macro-recorder-button-exercise.png)

## Step 5
Select **Blank Workbook**.
## Step 6
Select the entire first row, then assign it a background color:
 

![excel exercise](..\media\excel-exercise.png)

## Step 7
The Preview window should look like this:
 

![recorded actions exercise](..\media\recorded-actions-exercise.png)

The automatically generated comment in the beginning can be deleted; highlight it and press the red ‘X’ to delete it:
 

![recorded actions exercise continued](..\media\recorded-actions-exercise-continued.png)

## Step 8
You may go ahead and add a comment as well, by pressing the bubble box button on the lower right:
 

![recorded actions exercise comment](..\media\recorded-actions-exercise-comment.png)

## Step 9
Press **Finish**. Your recorded Actions have been added to the Process:
 

![recorded actions exercise comment workspace](..\media\recorded-actions-exercise-comment-workspace.png)

You may also try experimenting with **Based on Coordinates** recording mode to see the differences between the two approaches.
