title:  Best Practices in Securing and Governing Power Automate Environments
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 

In this module, we will discuss strategies that can be used to establish
governance and change management processes. We will also discuss the
governance tools that Microsoft provides. When makers use Power Platform tools to
improve their productivity, administrators can empower those users to help scale the organization.

We will review the Admin Analytics feature, found in the Power Platform Admin Center, which is
is a valuable tool for administrators to get insights into their users.

For situations where administrators want more control, we will highlight
many PowerShell Cmdlets that can be used to provide administrators with
more visibility into their user's actions. We will also
learn how to search Office 365 Security and Compliance
logs, using a flow template, for Power Automate events.
