In the previous modules of this learning path, we discussed the role of
environments, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies and some of the tools
that we can use to manage these features. In this module, we'll discuss how administrators can prepare for making governance changes through proactive change management.

Change management is important as it reduces the friction that may occur
when changes are made to Power Platform environments, that makers are
not prepared for. If makers are not prepared for these changes,
inevitably, people's expectations won't be met. For example, a maker
that has built a flow that provides business critical automation won't be happy if someone changes a DLP policy that ultimately breaks, or
disables, their flow. Understanding what connectors are being used and
who has included them in their flows gives an administrator more
confidence about the change they are about to make.

Another consideration is that change management is not about limiting
what people can do. The opposite is also true when you identify when
people are doing "good things" with the Power Platform. If you can
identify these "champions", then it may be a good idea to see how they
can be further empowered to help the organization achieve greater
business results.

In the following sections, we'll discuss different tools and
techniques that can be used to gain insights that will help
administrators manage change in their environments.
