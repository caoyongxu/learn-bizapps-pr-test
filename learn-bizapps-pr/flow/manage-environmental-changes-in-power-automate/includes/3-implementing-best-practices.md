Communicating changes to DLP can be a challenging endeavor and will
differ depending upon organization design. In this section, we will
discuss approaches that can be used to communicate DLP change
information to your makers.

Here are some strategies to consider:

1.  Create an Intranet/Wiki site that can be used for makers to
    reference so they understand what DLP policies exist.

2.  Track all flow users in a digital list. This can be a Yammer group,
    SharePoint list, distribution list or Azure Active Directory group
    or by using the Power Platform Center of Excellence Starter Kit that
    we discussed in Module 1.

    **Note:** In Module 5 we will build a digital list that helps you
    track new users.

3.  Communicate upcoming DLP changes in your IT Change Management
    meetings. An IT Change Board is a common vehicle for IT
    organizations to communicate changes. Part of their purpose is to
    ensure the right level of rigor is applied to changes, but these
    meetings are also used to communicate changes to other stakeholders
    who may have a dependency on your service.

4.  Send out advance notice to all makers of upcoming DLP changes, by
    leveraging the digital list that was discussed in step 2. Ideally,
    this process is also automated, using Power Automate to reduce
    manual activities.

5.  Provide a channel, like a distribution list or service desk queue,
    for makers to communicate with should they have questions or
    concerns. As part of the communication that gets sent out, ensure
    makers have an outlet that they can use to request additional
    assistance if required.

6.  Be prepared for exceptions. In Module 1, we discussed the need for
    exception environments where DLP rules are relaxed. As part of the
    communication that goes out to makers, they may have some legitimate
    needs to continue to use connectors in their current configuration.
    To address these needs, organizations should look to automate this
    process using a Microsoft Form that connects to a Power Automate
    flow that includes automated approvals.
