Thisâ€¯module explored how you can share a cloud flow with other users. If you share a cloud flow by using co-ownership, you can enable others to collaborate on building the flow. You can enable others to run your flow on demand by sharing instant cloud flows without giving them extra access. Use the **Send a copy** feature to share a cloud flow with another user who can use it as a template to create their own copy. You can also include cloud flows in Dataverse solutions, which enable the transporting and sharing of flows between the environments. In this module, you learned when to use each of these techniques for sharing cloud flows.
