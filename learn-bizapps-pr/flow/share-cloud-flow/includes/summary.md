Thisâ€¯module explored how you can share a cloud flow with other users. By sharing a cloud flow using co-ownership, you can enable others to collaborate on building the flow. You can enable others to run your flow on demand by sharing instant cloud flows without giving them any extra access. Use the send copy feature to share a cloud flow with another user who can use it as a template to create their own copy. Cloud flows can also be included in Dataverse solutions, which enables transporting and sharing flows between the environments. In this module, you learned when to use each of these techniques for sharing cloud flows.
