Automating Active Directory related tasks allows administrators to considerably reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to add, remove, or update users, user roles and objects in the Active Directory server. Any company with a large number of users would greatly benefit from automating Active Directory user and object management.

Consider the example of a large company, whose IT department must create a new Active Directory user for every new hire. The new employee’s details are received by e-mail from HR. The e-mail is parsed, and the employee’s details are stored in variables. 

WinAutomation connects to the Active Directory server, creates a new user with the details and credentials provided. The user is added to a group, and a computer object is created for them as well.

This module will demonstrate some of the most common uses of Active Directory Actions.
