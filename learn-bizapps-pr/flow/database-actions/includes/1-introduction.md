Databases are a vital part of every organization, and efficient data handling is necessary for their effective operation. Inserting, retrieving, and modifying data is fundamental for every information system.

Retrieving data from databases and using it in applications, are a common occurrence in enterprises. Most of the information systems implement this behavior by combining databases with CRMs, ERPs, or other business software. 

By automating database-related processes, users can replicate scheduled operations and disengage themselves from repetitive tasks. For this purpose, WinAutomation offers a whole group of actions that supports connectivity and SQL queries on all databases.
