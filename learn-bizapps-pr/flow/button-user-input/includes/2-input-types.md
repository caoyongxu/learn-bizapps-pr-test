In this unit, you'll create a flow button that will allow a user to report damage
that was noticed on the company's property. The data will be saved on a SharePoint
list.

1. Go to the SharePoint online site where you would like to store damage report information.

1. On the upper left of the SharePoint site, select the **+ New** drop-down menu and then select **List**.

    > [![Screenshot of SharePoint Home page with the New menu expanded and List highlighted.](../media/sharepoint-new-list.jpg)](../media/sharepoint-new-list.jpg#lightbox)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Create a list with Blank list highlighted.](../media/blank-list.png)](../media/blank-list.png#lightbox)

1. Give the list a name,
    such as **Reported Property Damage**. Select **Create**. you'll be automatically redirected
    to the new list. The list will automatically have the **Title** field option available.

    and looks like a gear icon. Hovering your mouse over the icon will show the
    **Settings** option. Next, select **List settings**, which will take you
    to the **Reported property damage settings** page. In the middle of the
    screen, you'll see the **Columns** section, which already has the **Title** option available.

    name and, this time, select **Date and Time** as the type of column.
