Having a flow button to trigger flows that require user input is simple and effective. You can use six different types of inputs in your flows: **Text**, **Yes/No**, **File**, **Email**, **Number**, and **Date**.

These inputs allow you to capture information from the user to then use
in the flow. This module explained how to implement flows that
required user input, and it directly integrated with features of Microsoft
Outlook such as Out of Office and Tasks.
