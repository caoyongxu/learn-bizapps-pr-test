Having a button to trigger flows that require user input is simple
and effective. You can use six different types of inputs in your
flows: **Text**, **Yes/No**, **File**, **Email**, **Number**, and **Date**.

These inputs allow you to capture information from the user to then use
in the flow and run differently depending on the inputs made. This module
explained how to implement flows that require user input, and how flows can directly
integrate with features of Microsoft Outlook such as Tasks.
