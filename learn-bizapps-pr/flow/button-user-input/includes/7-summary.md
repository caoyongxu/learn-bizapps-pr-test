You have seen how easy and effective Flow button is to trigger flows
that require a user input. There are six different types of inputs for
you to utilize in your flows: Text, Yes/No, File, Email, Number, Date.
These inputs allow you to capture information from the user to then use
in the flow. This module walked you through implementing flows that
required user input and directly integrated with features of Microsoft
Outlook such as out of office and tasks.
