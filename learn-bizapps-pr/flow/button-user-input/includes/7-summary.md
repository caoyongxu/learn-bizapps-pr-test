You have seen how easy and effective a flow button is to trigger flows
that require a user input. There are six different types of inputs for
you to utilize in your flows: Text, Yes/No, File, Email, Number, Date.

These inputs allow you to capture information from the user to then use
in the flow. This module walked you through implementing flows that
required a user input and directly integrated with features of Microsoft
Outlook such as Out of Office and Tasks.
