Building a Power Automate flow is the same as building any other
workflow. You have a start and an end. A flow always starts with a
trigger action and in this module we are focusing on Manually triggering
a flow using buttons with user input. After the trigger you add steps.
Each step can be an action or a condition or a combination of actions
and conditions. The flow always ends with an action.

There are two ways to design the process for a Button Flow, one is to
use an existing template with a button trigger and the second is to
build one from blank.

### The six different types of user inputs

Power Automate flow currently has six different types of user inputs. They are:

- Text

- Yes/No
 
- File
 
- Email
 
- Number
 
- Date

### Text

Text input is best used to add text. When you click on the ellipses or
the three dots ... at the end, you will see three options and delete.
The options are:

- Add a drop-down list of options

- Add a multi-select list of options

- Make the field optional

### Yes/No

As the input name states, it is best used to select yes or no options.

### File content

File content can be used to upload files and images.

### Email

Email input is where you enter the e-mail address. The other inputs
complement the use of Email input.

### Number

As the input name states, it is best used to add a numerical value.

### Trigger date

For the trigger date input, you can either enter or select a date.

**Yes/No, File Content, Email, Number and Trigger date** have the same
options, for example to **Make the field optional** and **Delete**.
