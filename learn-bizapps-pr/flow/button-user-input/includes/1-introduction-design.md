Building an instant cloud flow that is triggered by a virtual button is the same as building other Power Automate flows where you've a start and an end. A flow always starts with a trigger action, and this module focuses on manually triggering a flow by using buttons with user input. After you've added the trigger, you'll add steps. Each step can be an action, a condition, or a combination of actions and conditions. The flow always ends with an action.

Two ways to design the process for a button flow are by using
an existing template with a button trigger and by building a template from blank.
