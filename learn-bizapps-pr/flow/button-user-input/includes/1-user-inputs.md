| Input type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Text** | **Text** input is best used for adding text. When you select the ellipsis (...) at the upper-right edge of the screen, you'll see the **Delete** option and three other options: add a drop-down list of options, add a multi-select list of options, and make the field optional. |
| **Yes/No** | The **Yes/No** input type is best used to select yes or no options. |
| **File** | The **File** content input type can be used to upload files and images. |
| **Email** | The **Email** input type is where you would enter an email address. The other inputs complement the use of email input. |
| **Number** |The **Number** input type is best used to add a numerical value. |
| **Date** | For the trigger **Date** input type, you can either enter or select a date. |

The **Yes/No**, **File**, **Email**, **Number**, and **Date** input types have the same
options, for example, to **Make the field optional** and **Delete**.
