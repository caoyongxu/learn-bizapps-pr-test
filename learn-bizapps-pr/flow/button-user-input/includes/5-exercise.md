This exercise will walk you through using an existing button template to
add a new Outlook task rather than creating a button flow from blank, which
we did earlier in this module.

We are going to use the **Create a new Outlook Task** template.

Follow these steps.

1.  [Sign in to Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true). 

1.  On the left vertical menu click on **Templates**.

1.  Right below the **Search templates...** you will see a several options such as **All flows**, **Featured**, **Shared with me**, etc. Find and click the **Button** option.

1.  Click on **sign in**.

1.  A temporary authentication pop-up window may appear and may require you to add your username and password.

1.  Click on **Create Flow**.

1.  Your new flow will automatically be created.

1.  You can now test the button using your smart phone. Open the app and click on the **Buttons** option 
    on the bottom horizontal menu. You should see the **Create new Outlook Task** button. Click on this 
    button.

1.  Add a task name and task description and click on **Done** which is available on the top right-hand 
    side of the app.

1.  Verify that you see the new task.
