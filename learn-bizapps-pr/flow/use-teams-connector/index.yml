title: Use the Teams connector in Power Automate
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  A fully automated process joins many concepts and capabilities in Power Automate. This module shows how to bring those concepts together to build a robust automation that involves multiple programs.
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Integrate a Microsoft Teams-based approval model and the associated conditional logic into an existing cloud flow.
    - Integrate the desktop flow for entering the invoice information into the approval process.
    - Integrate Microsoft Outlook-based approval/rejection notifications into the invoice process.
    - Test the end-to-end invoice processing cloud flow.
prerequisites: Basic understanding of Microsoft Power Automate. This module builds off the Build your first Power Automate Desktop flow, the Use input and output parameters, the Create a Gateway to Desktop flow, the Integration with Outlook connector, and the Use AI builder to process invoice forms modules.
