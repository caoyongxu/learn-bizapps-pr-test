Now you know how to design an end-to-end Robotic Process Automation (RPA) from automated emails and form processing to approvals and performing actions in desktop applications. You can use these concepts to build out nearly any process in Power Automate, reducing the amount of time you spend on necessary but repetitive tasks.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you can:

- Integrate a Teams-based approval model and the associated conditional logic into an existing Cloud flow.

- Integrate the Desktop flow for entering the invoice information into the approval process

- Integrate Outlook-based approval/rejection notifications into the invoice process

- Perform a test of the end-to-end invoice processing Cloud flow

## Key takeaways

Here are the three key takeaways:

- Dynamic content enables you to use information from previous steps in a flow.

- With hundreds of connectors, you can design a truly robust RPA using Power Automate.

- Solutions allow you to integrate various programs such as Teams and Outlook with legacy desktop applications.
