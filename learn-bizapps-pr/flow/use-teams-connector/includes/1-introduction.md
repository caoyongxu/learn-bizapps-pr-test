With Power Automate, you can design an end-to-end Robotic Process Automation (RPA) from automated emails and form processing to approvals and performing actions in desktop applications. Approvals are an integral part of many company processes, but preparing, requesting, and waiting for an approval can be time consuming. Instead, you can build out the process in Power Automate to reduce the amount of time you spend on necessary but repetitive tasks, and where better to request an approval than the program in which you spend most of your time collaborating and chatting: Teams.

In this module, you will:

- Integrate a Teams-based approval model and the associated conditional logic into an existing Cloud flow.

- Integrate the Desktop flow for entering the invoice information into the approval process

- Integrate Outlook-based approval and rejection notifications into the invoice process

- Perform a test of the end-to-end invoice processing Cloud flow

This module uses an existing solution as a basis for creating the flow with Teams approval. The solution includes a desktop flow built in Power Automate Desktop to perform actions in an invoicing application. The desktop flow contains various input and output variables and is connected to a cloud flow via a gateway that is triggered by receiving an email in Outlook and then uses a customize AI form processing model to analyze attachments. All of this is packaged in a Solution in Power Automate. You can use this module to learn the concepts involved in creating approvals in Teams for your own solution, or you can build off the previous modules to recreate the example solution.
