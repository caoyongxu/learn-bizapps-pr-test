With Microsoft Power Automate, you can design an end-to-end robotic process automation (RPA), from automated emails and form processing to approvals and taking actions in desktop applications. Approvals are an integral part of many company processes, but preparing, requesting, and waiting for an approval can be time-consuming. Instead, you can build the process in Power Automate to reduce the amount of time that you spend on necessary but repetitive tasks. Also, you'll be able to request an approval in a program in which you spend most of your time collaborating and chatting: Microsoft Teams.

In this module, you will:

- Integrate a Teams-based approval model and the associated conditional logic into an existing cloud flow.

- Integrate the desktop flow for entering the invoice information into the approval process.

- Integrate Microsoft Outlook-based approval and rejection notifications into the invoice process.

- Test the end-to-end invoice processing cloud flow.

This module uses an existing solution as a basis for creating the flow with Teams approval. The solution includes a desktop flow that is built in Power Automate for desktop to take actions in an invoicing application. The desktop flow contains various input and output variables and is connected to a cloud flow through a gateway that is triggered by receiving an email in Outlook. Then, the flow uses a customized AI form processing model to analyze attachments. These features are packaged together in a Power Automate solution. You can use this module to learn the concepts that are involved in creating approvals in Teams for your own solution, or you can build off the previous modules to re-create the example solution.
