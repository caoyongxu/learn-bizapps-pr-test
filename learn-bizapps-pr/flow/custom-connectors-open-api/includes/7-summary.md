In this module, you've learned how to configure Microsoft’s OpenAPI extensions to make your custom connector easier for the maker to use.  You learned that the OpenAPI specification allows extensions to be described and how the custom connectors use them.  Some of the Microsoft OpenAPI extensions are configured using the designer and some require direct OpenAPI definition modification. You saw how you could use the dynamic values and dynamic schema extensions to configure your action’s parameters to be context-sensitive and be determined when a maker is using the action and not at the connector design time.

Some of the extensions require support by the underlying API. When you're designing the custom connector, you should consider your ability to modify the API to support the necessary operations.
