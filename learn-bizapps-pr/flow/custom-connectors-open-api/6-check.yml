  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You've implemented a custom connector that uses API Key authentication. You want to have it validate the key at connection creation time. What should you do to implement this action? 
    choices: 
    - content: Configure an OpenAPI extension x-ms-capabilities with the testConnection property configured. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This extension will call the configured operation when a connection is created and will report failure for an invalid key. 
    - content: Use a policy template to set the key in the header. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Creating a policy template won't validate the connection at creation time.
    - content: Enable the test connection feature in the custom connector designer. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The connector designer doesn't have this feature.
    - content: Include {KEY} placeholder as the key value and the connection designer will replace it with a valid key when creating a connection.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Connection creation doesn't support placeholders; you need to provide the way for the designer to test the connection instead. 
  - content: The parameters on one of your custom connector actions vary based on the selected category parameter value. You want users to only see parameters that are valid for a specific category. What should you do to implement this specification? 
    choices: 
    - content: Use a policy template. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't implement dynamic schema by using a policy template.
    - content: Configure a Dynamic Schema OpenAPI extension. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This extension will call the configured operation when a connection is created and will report failure for an invalid key. 
    - content: Configure a Dynamic Values OpenAPI extension. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Dynamics values extension allows the list of values to be retrieved at run-time, but it doesn't support dynamic schema that is required in this scenario.
    - content: Use Swagger editor to enter the list of valid parameters that are sorted by category according to OpenAPI specifications. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: OpenAPI specifications don't support dynamic schema definitions.
  - content: You want to configure Dynamic Values for a parameter on your custom connector action. What support do you need from the API to allow you to complete this configuration? 
    choices: 
    - content: API needs to be compliant with OpenAPI specifications.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: OpenAPI specifications don't include definitions for the dynamic values.
    - content: API needs to include an operation that returns the schema for the parameter. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You need an operation that returns the valid list of values for that parameter, not the schema.
    - content: API needs to include an operation that returns an array of valid values for that parameter. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This extension will call the configured operation to get the values to populate the drop-down list from which the user selects values for that parameter. 
    - content: Nothing, dynamic values only work with an array of values that are specified in the OpenAPI definition. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Dynamic values extension retrieves available values by using an API operation instead of a fixed array. 
  - content: Which of the following is an alternative option to configure an OpenAPI extension if you donâ€™t want to use the Swagger editor? 
    choices: 
    - content: Configure the extension when you build a Power Automate flow. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't configure an OpenAPI extension in the Power Automate designer. 
    - content: Use the Power Platform command-line tool and the editor of your choice. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This option allows you to download the definition, make the changes, and update the custom connector definition without using the Swagger editor. 
    - content: Use Solution explorer to configure the extension.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You can't configure an OpenAPI extension in the Solution explorer. 
    - content: Swagger editor is the only available method of configuring an OpenAPI extension.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Connector definitions can be downloaded and edited outside of the Swagger editor.
