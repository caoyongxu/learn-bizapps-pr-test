  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You've implemented a custom connector that uses API Key authentication.  You would like to have it validate the key at connection creation time.  What should you do to implement this? 
    choices: 
    - content: Configure an OpenAPI extension x-ms-capabilities with the testConnection property configured. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This extension will call the configured operation when a connection is created and report failure for an invalid key. 
    - content: Use a Policy Template to set the key in the header. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Creating a policy template won't validate the connection at creation time.
    - content: Enable test connection feature in the custom connector designer. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The connector designer doesn't have this feature.
    - content: Include {KEY} placeholder as the key value and the connection designer will replace it with a valid key when creating a connection.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Connection creation doesn't support placeholders; you need to provide the way for the designer to test the connection instead. 
  - content: The parameters on one of your custom connector actions vary based on the category parameter value selected.  You would like users to only see parameters that are valid for a specific category.  What should you do to implement this? 
    choices: 
    - content: Use a Policy Template. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't implement dynamic schema using a policy template.
    - content: Configure a Dynamic Schema OpenAPI extension. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This extension will call the configured operation when a connection is created and report failure for an invalid key. 
    - content: Configure a Dynamic Values OpenAPI extension. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Dynamics values extension allows the list of values to be retrieved at run-time, but it doesn't support dynamic schema required in this scenario.
    - content: Use Swagger editor to enter the list of valid parameters sorted by category as per OpenAPI specifications. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: OpenAPI specifications don't support dynamic schema definitions.
  - content: You would like to configure Dynamic Values for a parameter on your custom connector action.  What support do you need from the API to allow you to configure this? 
    choices: 
    - content: API needs to be compliant with OpenAPI specifications.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: OpenAPI specifications don't include any definitions for the dynamic values.
    - content: API needs to include an operation that returns the schema for the parameter. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You need an operation that returns the valid list of values for that parameter, not the schema.
    - content: API needs to include an operation that returns an array of valid values for that parameter. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This extension will call the configured operation to get the values to populate the dropdown list that the user selects values from for that parameter. 
    - content: Nothing, Dynamic values only work with an array of values specified in the OpenAPI definition. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Dynamic values extension retrieves available values using an API operation instead of a fixed array. 
  - content: Which of the following is an alternative option to configure an OpenAPI extension if you donâ€™t want to use the Swagger editor? 
    choices: 
    - content: Configure the extension when you build a Power Automate flow. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't configure an OpenAPI extension in the Power Automate designer. 
    - content: Use the Power Platform command-line tool and the editor of your choice. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This allows you to download the definition make the changes and update the custom connector definition without using the Swagger editor. 
    - content: Use Solution explorer to configure the extension.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You can't configure an OpenAPI extension in the Solution explorer. 
    - content: Swagger editor is the only available method of configuring an OpenAPI extension.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Connector definitions can be downloaded and edited outside of the Swagger editor.
