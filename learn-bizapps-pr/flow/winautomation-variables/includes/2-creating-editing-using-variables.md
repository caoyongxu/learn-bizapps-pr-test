This unit explores each part of the following variable functionality:

- Creating variables
- The **Variable Pane**
- Using variables
- Creating and editing variables using the **Variables Manager Window**

## Creating variables

There are two main ways to create a new variable:

- Through the **Variables Manager Window**. More information about the **Variables Manager Window** can be found in the following sections.

- By deploying an action. Most actions generate output and store it in an autogenerated variable.

## The Variables Pane

The **Variables Pane** is located by default next to the **Workspace** under the **Functions Pane** and enables you to review and handle variables. 

The pane contains four columns that present essential information about each variable, such as the name, the type, and the value of it.

By clicking on the first column of the **Variable Pane**, you can pin any variable on the top for quick access. Additionally, you can reorder variables by dragging and dropping them into the desired position. 

Besides providing information about the variables, the pane allows you to perform more complicated tasks, such as searching, renaming, and finding where each variable is used.

To rename a variable, double-click on it and populate the **New Name** field with the new name. To find its usages, make a right-click on it and select the respective option.

## Using variables

WinAutomation provides you with a simple and straightforward way to use variables that have been previously created in your processes.

There is a **Gear** icon next to every input field that accepts variables in each **Action's Properties** dialog. By clicking on this icon, you can directly select any variable or variable property and use it as an input.

Although the **Gear** icon is placed only next to the input fields, an existing variable can also be used as an output. By storing new data in an existing variable, you will overwrite its contents and, possibly, change the type of data the variable contains.

[!NOTE]
It is strongly suggested to use new variables to store different actions' outputs. This practice will help you keep your processes clear and provide a full understanding of what data each variable contains at any given time while the process is running.

## The Variables Manager Window

The **Variables Manager Window** is an essential part of the **Process Designer** and enables you to manage variables in your processes. 

To access the **Variables Manager Window**, navigate to **Tools** -> **Variables Manager** located on the **Process Designer's** main menu bar. 

In the **User Defined Variables** tab, a list of all the variables used in the process is displayed. Through the respective buttons, you can edit or delete any variable, as well as create a new one.

Keep in mind that an alternative way to declare new variables is to enter a variable name into an output field of any action of the process. If this name does not refer to an existing variable, a new variable will be created automatically. A variable created this way cannot be edited or deleted through the **Variables Manager Window**.

In the **Trigger Variables** tab, a list of all the trigger-related variables is displayed. Variables in this tab cannot be deleted, edited, or created.
