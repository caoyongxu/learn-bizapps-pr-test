When you are creating a process with WinAutomation, you may sometimes want to keep the value of a specific variable available for future process runs. Persistent variables allow you to do exactly that: keep a variableâ€™s value available for the next time that the process runs.

## Persistent variables

By marking a variable as persistent, you can be sure that its value will be kept between process runs. You can set a variable as persistent in the process designer, using the variables manager.

If the variable that you want to make persistent already exists, you can select it in the **User Defined Variables** tab and then select **Edit Variable**. If you want to create a brand new variable and make it persistent, select **Add New Variable**.

In the dialog box, you must enter a name for the new variable and select the **Variable is Persistent** option.

When you first create a persistent variable, it will not have any stored value. However, if you run the process and give the variable a specific value, you will be able to see the currently stored value from the edit variable window in the variable manager.

## External variables

If from one process (Process A) you run a different process (Process B) by using the Start process action, all variables of Process A are available to Process B. The variables in Process B are considered external variables and can be used for passing data from one process to another.

For Process B to access any of the external variables, the `ext:` prefix must be included before the variable name. For example, if Process A defines a variable `%MyData%`, Process B can access the value of that variable using the notation: `%ext:MyData%`.
