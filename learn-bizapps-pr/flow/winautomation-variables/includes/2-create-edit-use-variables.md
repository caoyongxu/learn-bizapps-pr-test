This unit explores each part of the following variable functionality:

- Creating variables
- The variable pane
- Using variables
- Creating and editing variables using the variables manager window

## Creating variables

There are two main ways to create a new variable:

- Through the variables manager window.

- By deploying an action. Most actions generate output and store it in an autogenerated variable.

## Variables Pane

The variables pane is located by default next to the Workspace under the functions pane and enables you to review and handle variables. 

The pane contains four columns that present essential information about each variable, including name, type, and value.

By clicking on the first column of the variables pane, you can pin any variable on the top for quick access. Additionally, you can reorder variables by dragging and dropping them into the desired position. 

Besides providing information about the variables, the pane allows you to perform more complicated tasks, such as searching, renaming, and finding where each variable is used.

To rename a variable, double-click on it and populate the **New Name** field. To find how a variable is used, right-click it.

## Using variables

To reuse previously created variables, click the Gear icon next to each input field that accepts variables in an action's properties dialog. You can directly select any variable or variable property and use it as an input.

An existing variable can also be used as an output.

> [!NOTE]
> By storing new data in an existing variable, you will overwrite its contents and, possibly, change the type of data the variable contains. It is strongly suggested to use new variables to store different actions' outputs. This practice will help you keep your processes clear and provide a full understanding of what data each variable contains at any given time while the process is running.

## The Variables Manager Window

The variables manager window is an essential part of the process designer and enables you to manage variables in your processes. 

To access the variables manager window, navigate to **Tools** > **Variables Manager** located on the process designer's main menu bar. 

In the user defined variables tab, a list of all the variables used in the process is displayed. Through the respective buttons, you can edit or delete any variable, as well as create a new one.

You can also declare new variables by entering a variable name in the output field of any action of the process. If this name does not refer to an existing variable, a new variable will be created automatically. A variable created this way cannot be edited or deleted through the variables manager window.

In the trigger variables tab, a list of all the trigger-related variables is displayed. Variables in this tab cannot be deleted, edited, or created.
