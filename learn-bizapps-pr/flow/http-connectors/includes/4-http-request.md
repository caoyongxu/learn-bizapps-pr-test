This connector can use incoming API calls as triggers and actions.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Triggers list with When an H T T P request is received request.](../media/http-request.png)](../media/http-request.png#lightbox)

When used as a trigger it will automatically generate the URL, which can be used as a POST method.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the H T T P Post U R L field.](../media/http-request-received-trigger.png)](../media/http-request-received-trigger.png#lightbox)

Once it is saved the URL is generated.
