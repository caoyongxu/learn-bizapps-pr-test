The HTTP connectors give you the flexibility to connect to your data sources or web services for whom connectors are currently not available. These connectors provide several authentication methods. You can use Power Platform's Data Loss Prevention or DLP to make sure only the correct set of connectors are part of the same group and can communicate with each other. Hence you can make sure data received from HTTP connection can only communicate with other connectors you have allowed.
