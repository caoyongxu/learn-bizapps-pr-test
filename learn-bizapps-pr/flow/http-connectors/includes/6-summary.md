HTTP connectors give you the flexibility to connect to your data sources or web services for which connectors are currently not available. These connectors provide several authentication methods. You can use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in Microsoft Power Platform to ensure that only the correct connectors are part of the same group and can communicate with each other. Therefore, you can make sure that the data that is received from an HTTP connection can only communicate with other connectors that you have allowed.
