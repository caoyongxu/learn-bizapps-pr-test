**HTTP Webhook** is used towards connecting with services that require you to subscribe and then unsubscribe. This concept is like an email subscription service you use with websites to get the latest information. You must first subscribe to officially acknowledge you are ready to get the information and once you are done, you need to unsubscribe.

To connect to the URI the HTTP Webhook,** you will use the Subscribe Method and the Subscribe Authentication. The same steps are needed to Unsubscribe.
