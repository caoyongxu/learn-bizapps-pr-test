title: HTTP connectors 
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  HTTP connectors use Representational State Transfer (REST) services that allow users to interact directly with data by using web requests. This allows flow makers to tap into the full potential of what the web service has to offer in a secure manner and still use Power Automate flows. This module will focus on both the built-in and the premium HTTP connectors.
