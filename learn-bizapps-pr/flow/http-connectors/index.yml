title: Interact with data using web requests with HTTP connectors in Power Automate 
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  HTTP connectors use Representational State Transfer (REST) services that allow users to interact directly with data by using web requests. This allows flow makers to tap into the full potential of what the web service has to offer in a secure manner and still use Power Automate flows. This module will focus on both the built-in and the premium HTTP connectors.

    - An overview of the HTTP connector
    - An overview of the HTTP Webhook connector
    - An overview of the HTTP with Azure AD connector
    - An overview of the When an HTTP request is received built-in connector
prerequisites: The Target Audience should have a basic understanding of how to create flows with SharePoint as the trigger.
