- Record actions that are performed in the desktop-based Contoso Invoicing application by using these inputs and capturing application data for output.

- Perform a test run of a new desktop flow with a new set of inputs.

## Key takeaways

The key takeaways for this module are:

- Input variables allow you to feed information into your desktop flow.
