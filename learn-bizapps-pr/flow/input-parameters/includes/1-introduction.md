Automating mundane tasks will allow you to increase productivity and to spend time on more meaningful tasks. To automate desktop action effectively, you not only need to define the actions, you also need to define inputs and outputs. It wouldn't be nearly as useful to write a flow that put in the exact same invoice every run. In this module, you will learn how to better leverage desktop flows by defining and altering the information used in them.

In this module, you will:

- Create a Desktop Flow with predefined inputs

- Record actions performed in the desktop-based Contoso invoicing application using these inputs, and capturing application data for output

- Perform a test run of a new Desktop Flow with a new set of inputs

If you do not already have a desktop flow built from which you can set inputs and outputs, you may want to check out this module.
