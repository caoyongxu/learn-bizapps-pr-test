In this module, you learned how to configure triggers on a custom connector. By configuring a trigger, you can enable your Power Automate flows and Azure Logic Apps workflows to run only when new data or events are available from the underlying API. The automation doesn't have to implement logic to determine when an event has occurred or when new data is available. As a result, it's more focused on handling the event rather than state management. This module also discussed the two types of triggers that you can configure: polling and webhook. Each type of trigger has requirements for the API that must be satisfied to successfully configure a trigger. Make sure that you evaluate the API for which you're building a custom connector to determine if triggers exist that you should configure.
