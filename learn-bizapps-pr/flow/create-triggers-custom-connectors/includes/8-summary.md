In this module, you've learned how to configure triggers on a custom connector. By configuring a trigger, you can enable your Power Automate flows and Azure Logic Apps workflows to run only when new data or events are available from the underlying API. The automation doesn't have to implement logic to determine when an event has occurred, or new data is available. It's then more focused on handling the event and not state management. We covered the two types of triggers you can configure, polling and webhook.  Each type of trigger has requirements for the API that must be satisfied to successfully configure a trigger. Evaluate the API you're building a custom connector to determine if there are triggers you should configure.
