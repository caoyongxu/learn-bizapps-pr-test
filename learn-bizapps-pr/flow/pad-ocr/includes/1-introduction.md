Scanning documents is a common practice in most organizations and businesses. Though scanned documents can be sufficient for some tasks, manual data extraction is needed in most cases.

For example, finance departments usually review a significant amount of receipts and invoices provided by employees and partners in a physical or image form.

The automation of these tasks can increase efficiency across the organization and disengage employees from repetitive and unproductive data extraction procedures.
