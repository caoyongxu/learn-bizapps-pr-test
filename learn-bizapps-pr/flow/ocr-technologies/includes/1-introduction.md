Scanning documents is a common practice in most organizations and businesses. Although an image of a document can be enough for some tasks, manual data extraction is needed in most cases. 

WinAutomation enables users to read, extract, and manage the data contained within all sorts of files through OCR technologies. The platform supports the **Microsoft MODI** and the **Google Tesseract** OCR engines, while it provides various related actions.

Using OCR actions, you can deal with the most challenging workflows that would typically require human intervention.
