Scanning documents is a common practice in most organizations and businesses. Though an image of a document can be sufficient for some tasks, manual data extraction is needed in most cases. 

WinAutomation gives users the ability to read, extract, and manage data that is contained within an assortment of files through optical character recognition (OCR) technologies. The platform supports the **Microsoft MODI** and the **Google Tesseract** OCR engines while providing various related actions.
