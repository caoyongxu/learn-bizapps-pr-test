Within Power Automate, templates exist that allow app makers to use
blueprints that have been provided by Microsoft, Microsoft partners, and
the community. These templates are free to use and can act as
accelerators for people who are looking to solve a pre-determined problem.
After a maker has provisioned a template, they are free to make changes as
needed.

Anyone can submit a template, provided that its last run was successful, from
within the Power Automate maker portal. After the template has been submitted, Microsoft will
review the template for suitability, remove any personal identifiable
information, and publish it to the public gallery.

The public gallery can be accessed from the **Templates** link
in the left navigation menu. From the gallery, makers can search for specific
connectors or keywords that they are interested in. Additionally,
Microsoft has categorized the templates based on popular scenarios
like approvals, email, and calendar.

While many of the templates in the gallery target information
workers, some templates target Microsoft Power Platform governance
use cases. This module explores some of these templates that
can be used by administrators to improve their productivity when governing
Microsoft Power Platform.
