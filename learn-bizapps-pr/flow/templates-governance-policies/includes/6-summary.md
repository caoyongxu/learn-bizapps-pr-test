In this module we learned about templates including who creates them,
how they get published and who can access them. We also discovered that
templates can be a useful tool regardless of your role in the
organization. Some people may seek to use templates to automate their
Office 365 activities, but as we also discovered, there are templates
that we can use to help manage our governance needs. Lastly, we built a
flow that helps administrators manage an Office 365 group that we can
use to communicate change management and governance information to our
makers.
