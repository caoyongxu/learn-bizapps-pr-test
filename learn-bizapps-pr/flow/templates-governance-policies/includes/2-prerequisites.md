No licensing requirements exist for exploring templates
and using them. However, as you might have experienced in other modules,
the person who is performing administrative functions needs to have
either tenant or environment administrative privileges to perform those
functions, even when using the Power Platform Management connectors. In
addition, the person who is using these connectors needs to have a
[Power Automate P2 license](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/billing-questions/?azure-portal=true).
