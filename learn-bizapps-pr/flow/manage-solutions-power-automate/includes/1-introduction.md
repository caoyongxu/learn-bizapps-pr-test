Solutions allow you to package features such as Microsoft Power Apps apps (both canvas and model-driven), site maps, flows, entities, forms, custom connectors, web resources, Choices, charts, and fields, to transport from one environment to another. Only the metadata, such as entities and their columns and configuration data, are transported. No business data is transported.

Solutions are part of the overall Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) practice of Power Platform. Solutions are important mechanisms for implementing ALM. For more information, see [Solutions for implementing ALM](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/overview-alm/?azure-portal=true).

## Learn the basics:  Power Apps, Power Automate flows, Connection references, and Environment Variables

### Power Apps

Power Apps is a no-code/low-code platform for building apps that builds off of concepts similar to formulas in an Excel workbook like SUM and TEXT. You can use Power Apps to build simple solutions like vehicle inspection forms and status reports or complex business solutions for purchasing processes and inventory management. If you can envision an app to solve a business problem, then you can use your existing skills to build it. Although Power Apps is geared towards business users with little background in computer science and coding, Power Apps offers advanced functionality and the ability for seasoned developers to design complex applications with ease.

Power Apps can create three types of apps: canvas, model-driven, and portals. Each is suited to different scenarios and end users.

Canvas apps are a great option when you want to build an app from a blank canvas. You start by choosing the screen size: tablet or mobile, then you have a blank screen from which to build. You can interact with data in your app by adding data sources. Drag and drop various controls and add the desired functionality by writing Excel style formulas. Canvas apps provide you complete flexibility when building your apps.

Model-driven apps build from data in Dataverse. Power Apps will build you a great looking, fully functional app to add, edit, and view data. With model-driven apps, there's no need to worry about choosing the app size; it's responsive, meaning it works on mobile or tablet with no extra work by you. You define the relationships, forms, views, business rules, and more at the data layer, in the Dataverse, giving you enough control to get your business result without writing all of the formulas yourself.

Portals bring the power of no-code solutions to building externally facing websites. Through the Power Apps interface, you can build an anonymous or authenticated website that allows users to interact with data held in Dataverse. The same drag and drop experience you enjoy when building apps is available to build these rich, interactive websites.

### Power Automate flows

Microsoft Power Automate (previously known as Flow) is a service that allows you to create workflows that are either automated or manually triggered by a user. There are several templates available that may fully match your requirements or just require minor changes. Other options include creation from a Visio template, UI, and business process flows.

The designer feature that comes with Power Automate is user-friendly. Sometimes drawing your flow logic on a Visio diagram can help design a better workflow, and so the integration of Power Automate with Visio was created. In Visio, you use the BPMN Basic Shapes to design the flow and export it. You then import that file into Power Automate, after which you have the flexibility to make further enhancements.

UI flows bring Robotic Process Automation (RPA) directly into Power Automate. This functionality comes with either a Desktop or a Web app that you use to record the user interface, including clicks and keyboard input. This comes in handy to work with legacy applications that don't have APIs available.

Business process flows are built using Power Platform and Dataverse. You can also leverage Power Automate workflows. The business process is a series of steps that the user needs to complete in a specific stage. The business process flow visually guides the user through various stages. These flows are created and managed by using Power Automate, and several templates are readily available. These templates can use the entities that are already available, or you can use custom entities that you've created.

Power Automate flows that you create in a solution are known as solution-aware flows. You can build a new flow directly inside a solution. Also, you can edit and delete that flow.  

### Connection references

A connector is a user-friendly way to allow a service to connect with Power Automate. Each connector comes with a set of operations classified as **Actions** and **Triggers**. Once you connect to the service, these operations can be leveraged within your Power Automate workflow.

There are three separate categories of connectors, Standard, Premium, and Preview. Custom connectors and connectors for Azure Logic Apps fall under the Premium category. 

You can add connectors to a solution. You can add existing connectors to a solution or create new ones that automatically become part of that solution. 

### Environment variables
It used to be a common practice for all the data that was stored to be available in a single environment only. Now thanks to environment variables, you have the flexibility to transport your configuration data from one environment to another within the same tenant. After creating Environment variables in Dataverse for apps, you can consume them by retrieving data from the **Environment Variable Definition** and **Environment Variable Value** entities.

You can add environment variables in a solution. You can add an existing environment variable in solution or create a new one that automatically becomes part of that solution.

## Managed and unmanaged solutions 

Solutions are mechanisms for implementing ALM in Power Apps and Power Automate. A solution can be managed or unmanaged.

Unmanaged solutions are used while you're still in your development environment in the initial design, building, and testing phase. Unmanaged solutions should be considered your source for Microsoft Power Platform assets. When an unmanaged solution is deleted, only the solution container of any customizations that are included in it's deleted. All unmanaged customizations will remain in effect and belong to the default solution.

Managed solutions are used to deploy to any environment that isn't a development environment for that solution. This includes test, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), System Integration Testing (SIT), and production environments. To make it easier and faster, Managed solutions can be created independently from other managed solutions in the same environment. As an ALM best practice, managed solutions should be generated by exporting an unmanaged solution as managed and considered a build artifact.

It's important to note that changes can only be made to unmanaged solutions. If you need to modify a managed solution, you need to add them to an unmanaged solution. When you do this, you create a dependency between your unmanaged customizations and the managed solution. When a dependency exists, the managed solution can't be uninstalled until you remove the dependency.
Some managed components can't be edited. To verify whether a component can be edited, view the Managed properties. 

You can't export a managed solution. Also, when a managed solution is deleted (uninstalled), all the customizations and extensions included with it are removed.
