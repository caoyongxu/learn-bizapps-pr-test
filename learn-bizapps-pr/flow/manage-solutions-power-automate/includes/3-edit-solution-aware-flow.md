Editing a solution-aware app, flow, and table requires you to first select the items from your solution.

1. Sign in to Power Apps, select **Solutions**, and then select **Volunteer Request**.

   You should see all your apps, flows, and tables.

1. To edit the canvas app, select the app and then select **Edit**, which is available in the upper portion of the screen, or you can select the ellipsis. This action will take you directly into Power Apps studio.
