The only way to edit a solution-aware flow is by going to **Solutions**, clicking-on your solution, and select the flow to edit. Solution-aware flows do not show up in your **My flows**.

In this example, we are going to edit the flow we created above. The change is to change the text in the body of the **Send an email** step.

1. Click on **Solutions**, then select **Volunteer Request** solution, select the **Volunteer Request Notification** flow and then click on **Edit**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![edit solution](../media/edit-solution-aware-flow-step-1-ssm.png)](../media/edit-solution-aware-flow-step-1-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. In both, the email actions add the following text at the end.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![change the text in the body](../media/solution-flow-email-body-change-ssm.png)](../media/solution-flow-email-body-change-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Next, click on the **Save** on the top right of the screen and confirm the flow has been saved.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![flow saved](../media/flow-saved-ss.png)](../media/flow-saved-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Next, click on **Solutions** and **Volunteer Request** and confirm your flow has been recently modified. The next time this flow runs you will see the updated text in the email body.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![solution flow confirmation](../media/solution-flow-confirmation-ssm.png)](../media/solution-flow-confirmation-ssm.png#lightbox)
