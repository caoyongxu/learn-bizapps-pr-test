Editing a solution-aware app, flow and table requires you to first go into your solution and select the items from there. 

1. In this scenario we first sign into Power Apps and selected **Solutions** and then selected **Volunteer Request**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Select Solutions and Volunteer Request to access your solution.](../media/access-your-solution-ssm.png)](../media/access-your-solution-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Now you see all of your apps, flows and tables.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![See all of your apps, flows, and tables.](../media/all-items.png)](../media/all-items.png#lightbox)

1. To edit the canvas app, you first select the app and then select Edit. Edit is available on the top or using the ellipses. This will take you directly into the power apps studio. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Edit the canvas app by selecting Edit.](../media/edit-existing-app-ssm.png)](../media/edit-existing-app-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Similarly, select the flow and then select Edit. Edit is available on the top or using the ellipses. This will take you directly into edit mode of the flow.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Edit the flow by selecting Edit.](../media/edit-existing-flow-ssm.png)](../media/edit-existing-flow-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. For flows you can also select the icon which takes you into the details section of the flow. Details is where you can see run history, connections, owners, etc.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Details section displays history, connections, owners, etc.](../media/additional-features-ssm.png)](../media/additional-features-ssm.png#lightbox)
 
1. Finally, select the table then select Edit. Edit is available on the top or using the ellipses. This will take you to the section where you can view the columns, relationships, business rules, etc. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Edit the table by selecting Edit.](../media/edit-existing-table-ssm.png)](../media/edit-existing-table-ssm.png#lightbox)
 
The bread crumb path shows where that table is located.
