The only way to edit a solution-aware flow is by going to **Solutions**, selecting your solution, and then selecting the flow to edit. Solution-aware flows don't show up in your **My flows** list.

In this example, you will edit the flow that you previously created by changing the text in the body of the **Send an email** step.

1. Select **Solutions > Volunteer Request > Volunteer Request Notification** flow and then select **Edit**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![edit solution](../media/edit-solution-aware-flow-step-1-ssm.png)](../media/edit-solution-aware-flow-step-1-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. In both email actions, add the following text at the end.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![change the text in the body](../media/solution-flow-email-body-change-ssm.png)](../media/solution-flow-email-body-change-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Save** button in the upper-right corner of the screen and then confirm that the flow has been saved.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![flow saved](../media/flow-saved-ss.png)](../media/flow-saved-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Solutions > Volunteer Request** and confirm that your flow has been recently modified. The next time that this flow runs, you will see the updated text in the email body.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![solution flow confirmation](../media/solution-flow-confirmation-ssm.png)](../media/solution-flow-confirmation-ssm.png#lightbox)
