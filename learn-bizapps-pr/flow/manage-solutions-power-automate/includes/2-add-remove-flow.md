The following steps walk you through the process of creating a flow and adding it to a solution.

1. To create a simple flow and add it to a solution, click on the new **Volunteer Request** solution you created and then click on the **+ New** option on the top. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![new Volunteer Request](../media/plus-new-volunteer-solution-ssm.png)](../media/plus-new-volunteer-solution-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Select Flow.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![select new flow](../media/select-new-flow-ssm.png)](../media/select-new-flow-ssm.png#lightbox)

	Here is the name of the flow and the initial trigger.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Flow name and initial trigger](../media/flow-name-trigger-ssm.png)](../media/flow-name-trigger-ssm.png#lightbox)

	Below is the remaining design of the flow.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![remaining design of the flow](../media/simple-flow-request-ss.png)](../media/simple-flow-request-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Click on **Save** that is available on the top-right.

1. Check and confirm the flow has been saved and then click on the left arrow icon.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![confirm the flow saved](../media/flow-saved-ss.png)](../media/flow-saved-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Next, let's go back and validate the flow has been created and is part of the solution. Click on **Solutions,** on the vertical navigation on the left, then click on **Volunteer Solution**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Go back and validate the flow has been created](../media/back-solution-ssm.png)](../media/back-solution-ssm.png#lightbox)

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Power Automate flow and is now part of the solution.

## How to remove a flow from a solution 

Power Automate flows that are part of a solution DO NOT show up in the Flows. For example, the new flow we created above does not show up in the flows list. The only way you can find it is by clicking on solutions and then click on your solution name.

> [![alt text](../media/solution-flow-missing-ssm.png)](../media/solution-flow-missing-ssm.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> Do not complete the steps below if you are following along. The Volunteer Request Notification flow will be referenced in later sections.

To remove the solution, select the solution name and then click on Remove. For example, Click on **Solutions**, then select **Volunteer Request** solution, select the **Volunteer Request Notification** flow, and then click on **Remove**.
