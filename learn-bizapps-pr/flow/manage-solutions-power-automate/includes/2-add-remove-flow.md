In this exercise, you will create new apps, flows, and tables and then remove them from the solution. Your first task is to create a solution:

1. To create a solution, sign in to Power Apps and then select **Solutions**, which is available in the left vertical navigation. 
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Select Solutions and + New solution.](../media/click-flow-solution-ssm.png)](../media/click-flow-solution-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Add the **Display name**, select **CDS Default Publisher**, and then enter a **Description**. Select **Create**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Add the details and click Create.](../media/save-solution-information-ss.png)](../media/save-solution-information-ss.png#lightbox)
 
	Congratulations, you have created your new solution.
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![your new solution.](../media/new-solution-created-ssm.png)](../media/new-solution-created-ssm.png#lightbox)

You can now create new apps, flows, and tables into this solution or add existing ones.

1. To add new apps, flows, and tables, select the **Volunteer Request** solution, select **+ New** in the upper-left corner of the screen, and then select your option.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Click +New to add new apps, flows, and tables.](../media/add-new-flow-app-table-ssm.png)](../media/add-new-flow-app-table-ssm.png#lightbox) 

1. To add existing apps, flows, and tables, select **+ Add existing**. Select **App** to add existing apps, **Table** to add existing tables (previously known as entities), and **Flow** to add existing flows.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Click + Add existing to add existing apps, flows, and tables.](../media/add-existing-apps-flows-tables-ssm.png)](../media/add-existing-apps-flows-tables-ssm.png#lightbox)
 
After you've finished adding items, your solution should resemble the following screenshot.
