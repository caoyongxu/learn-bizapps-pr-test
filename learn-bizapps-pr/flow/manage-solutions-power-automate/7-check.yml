  questions: 
  - content: Name the types of solutions.
    choices: 
    - content: 2 - Zipped & Unzipped
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Managed solutions are used to deploy to any environment that isn't a development environment for that solution. Unmanaged solutions are used in development environments while you make changes to your application.
    - content: 2 - Managed & Unmanaged
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Managed solutions are used to deploy to any environment that isn't a development environment for that solution. Unmanaged solutions are used in development environments while you make changes to your application.
    - content: 1 - Managed
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Managed solutions are used to deploy to any environment that isn't a development environment for that solution. Unmanaged solutions are used in development environments while you make changes to your application.
    - content: 3 - Managed, Unmanaged & Published
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Managed solutions are used to deploy to any environment that isn't a development environment for that solution. Unmanaged solutions are used in development environments while you make changes to your application.
  - content: When can you add an item (such as flow, app, environment variable) to a solution?
    choices: 
    - content: You can only add new items to a new solution.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You have the flexibility to add existing items such as flow and app to either an existing solution or a new solution.
    - content: New solutions will not accept existing items.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You have the flexibility to add existing items such as flow and app to either an existing solution or a new solution.
    - content: You can add an existing item and a new item to an existing or new solution
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You have the flexibility to add existing items such as flow and app to either an existing solution or a new solution.
    - content: Items removed cannot be added back.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You have the flexibility to add existing items such as flow and app to either an existing solution or a new solution.
  - content: Which of the following statements regarding solution exporting and importing is true?
    choices: 
    - content: Exporting and importing can only be in a single environment.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can export the solutions as a zipped file and import then into another environment in the same tenant or an environment in a new tenant.
    - content: Exporting and importing can be across environments but must be in a single-tenant.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You can export the solutions as a zipped file and import then into another environment in the same tenant or an environment in a new tenant.
    - content: Exporting and importing can be across tenants but with the same licenses.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You can export the solutions as a zipped file and import then into another environment in the same tenant or an environment in a new tenant.
    - content: Exporting and importing can be cross environments and tenants.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: You can export the solutions as a zipped file and import then into another environment in the same tenant or an environment in a new tenant.
  - content: Do solutions automatically package dependent components?
    choices: 
    - content: No, they do not. For example, Option Set fields of an entity need to be added separately.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Not all dependent components get automatically packaged. For example, Option Set fields of an entity need to be added separately.
    - content: Yes. Solutions can automatically recognize interdependent components.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Not all dependent components get automatically packaged. For example, Option Set fields of an entity need to be added separately.
    - content: Yes, but only for the Power Apps app.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Not all dependent components get automatically packaged. For example, Option Set fields of an entity need to be added separately.
    - content: Yes, but only for Power Automate flows.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Not all dependent components get automatically packaged. For example, Option Set fields of an entity need to be added separately.
  - content: How do Power Apps canvas apps and Power Automate flows handle connection references?
    choices: 
    - content: Both Power Apps canvas apps and Power Automate flows handle connection references the same.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Power Automate flows and Power Apps apps handle connection references differently. Power Automate flows use connection references for all connectors, whereas Power Apps only uses it for implicitly shared connections.
    - content: Power Apps canvas apps references all connectors. Power Automate references implicitly shared connections such as SQL server.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Power Automate flows and Power Apps apps handle connection references differently. Power Automate flows use connection references for all connectors, whereas Power Apps only uses it for implicitly shared connections.
    - content: Power Automate flows use connection references for all connectors. Power Apps app only use them from implicitly shared connections such as SQL server.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Power Automate flows and Power Apps apps handle connection references differently. Power Automate flows use connection references for all connectors, whereas Power Apps only uses it for implicitly shared connections.
    - content: Both Power Apps canvas apps and Power Automate flows handle connection references the same but for cloud connections.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Power Automate flows and Power Apps apps handle connection references differently. Power Automate flows use connection references for all connectors, whereas Power Apps only uses it for implicitly shared connections.
