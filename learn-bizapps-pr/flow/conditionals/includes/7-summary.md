Conditional Actions allow Processes to modify their behavior during runtime, based on the available data. they are divided into two major categories in WinAutomation:
* The **If** group of Actions
* The **Switch** group of Actions

**Switch** may be used to compare a single variable to multiple values, while **If** allows more diverse comparisons.

All conditionals allow the definition of one or more alternative comparisons, as well as a final, unconditional alternative, to be executed when none of the alternative conditions have been met.
