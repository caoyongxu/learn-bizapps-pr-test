The ability to run actions based on whether certain conditions are met is an essential part of most business processes. Adapting a processâ€™ steps based on the available information is crucial for virtually every task, and allows it to handle complex scenarios and make decisions based on the available data.

Consider the automatic processing of billing information and pricing: each purchase may be applicable for a discount, whose height is determined by the total purchase amount, whether the customer is a partner or has a discount coupon, whether any special offers are in place, etc. These are all factors that are not constant, and must be considered while the Process is running. Using Conditional actions, users may automate such processes, streamlining decision making and greatly increasing efficiency.

In this module, you will learn about the different groups of conditionals, and how they are deployed based on the specifics of the available options. You will also use conditional Actions in a demo Process, in order to familiarize yourself with the different kinds of conditions that may be evaluated in the decision making of a Process.

By the end of this module, you will be able to understand the differences between the different conditional Actions, and use them to automate tasks based on runtime information.
## Learning Objectives
In this module, you will:
* Use the **If** group of conditionals to evaluate any type of condition
* Deploy the **Switch** group of conditionals in order to compare a single variable with multiple possible values
* Explore additional options when evaluating conditions
* Provide default and alternative behaviors to Processes based on the available data
## Prerequisites
* Basic familiarity with the WinAutomation Process Designer
