WinAutomation enables you to interact with any desktop or web application through controls. Every application consists of various controls, like buttons and text fields, that can be accessed by dedicated UI and web actions. 

Each control is specified by UI or CSS selectors, that pinpoint the specific elements you want to interact with. 
The created controls are stored in the **Controls Repository**, which is located on the bottom part of the **Process Designer** by default.

Besides **Controls Repository**, WinAutomation provides a repository that stores images. These images can be used by various actions, such as **Wait for Image** or **Move Mouse to Image** actions. 

By the end of the module, you will be able to handle these repositories and create controls for desktop and web automations.
