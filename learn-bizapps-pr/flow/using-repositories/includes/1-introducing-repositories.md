WinAutomation enables you to interact with any desktop or web application through controls. Every application consists of various controls, like buttons and text fields, that can be accessed by dedicated UI and web actions. 

Each control is specified by UI or CSS selectors that pinpoint the specific elements you want to interact with. 
The controls that you create are stored in the **Controls Repository**, which is visible in the Process Designer.

WinAutomation also provides a repository that stores images. These images can be used by various actions, such as **Wait for Image** or **Move Mouse to Image** actions. 

By the end of the module, you will be able to use these repositories to create controls for desktop and web automations.
