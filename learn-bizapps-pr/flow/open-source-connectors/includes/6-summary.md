In this module, you've learned about open-sourcing and certifying a custom connector. Open-sourcing makes the custom connector definition available to learn from and to contribute improvements. Once a connector is open-sourced, users can import it from GitHub into any Power Platform environment for use. If your custom connector meets the requirements for certification, you can submit it for approval and publishing in the official Microsoft list of connectors. Certified connectors can be used by environments in any public Power Platform region without any extra import or installation. You also explored how to safely evolve the definition of your connector without breaking existing apps and flows.
