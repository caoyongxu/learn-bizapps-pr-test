In this module, you've learned about creating an open-source connector and certifying it. Creating an open-source connector makes the custom connector definition available for you to learn from and to contribute improvements. After a connector has been made as an open source, users can import it from GitHub into any Microsoft Power Platform environment for use. If your custom connector meets the requirements for certification, you can submit it for approval and publishing in the official Microsoft list of connectors. Certified connectors can be used by environments in any public Microsoft Power Platform region without extra import or installation. Finally, you explored how to safely evolve the definition of your connector without breaking existing apps and flows.
