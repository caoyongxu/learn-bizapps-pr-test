You can customize button flows by letting the user provide specific details that will be used when the flow runs.

You can create a button flow either on the Power Automate website or in the mobile app for Power Automate. For this unit, you'll use the website.

## Prerequisites

- Access to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

- A basic understanding of Power Automate and experience with creating a flow is recommended.

## Open the template

1. Launch Power Automate and sign in using your organizational account.

1. Select **Templates** and search *Create New Outlook Task*.

1. Sign in if you are prompted to do so and select **Create Flow**.

## Customize the user input

You'll notice that this flow already requests more input, but let's add another field.

1. Select **Edit** and on the trigger card, select **+ Add an input**.

1. For each custom field that should be available when someone runs your flow, enter values in the **Input title** and **Input description** field.

    In this example, you'll create one custom input field, **Due Date**.

    ![Screenshot of the Manually trigger a flow card with the Due date field and "Please enter or select a date (YYYY-MM-DD)" highlighted.](../media/due-date.png)

## Customize the task

1. On the **Create a task** card, select the title bar to expand the card.

1. For the Due Date field, search for "Due date" in the Dynamic Content search field and then select **Due Date**.

1. Select **Save**.

## Run the flow

You'll now use the mobile app for Power Automate to run the button flow that you created. You'll provide all the user input that's needed to create a task with a name, description, and due date.

1. In the mobile app for Power Automate, select the **Buttons** tab at the bottom of the window, and then select the **Create new Outlook Task** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Buttons tab with the Create new Outlook Task button highlighted.](../media/buttons-task.png)

1. Enter the requested inputs and select **Done**.

    The flow runs.

1. Select the **Activity** tab at the bottom of the window to view the results.

    ![Screenshot of the Feed tab. The Create new Outlook Task with "Flow successfully ran 1 time" is highlighted and the Activity button is highlighted.](../media/activity.png)

1. To view the detailed results of the flow run, select the **Create new Outlook Task**  flow at the top of your Activity Feed and then select the **Create a task** step.

Now you can not only run button flows with the already available information, but also request inputs from the user.
