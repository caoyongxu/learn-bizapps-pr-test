New Processes are created through the WinAutomation Console, using the **New Process** button.

Development takes place in the Process Designer. Actions are the basic building blocks of a Process, while Variables are used to store data to be used as input or output in Actions.

Actions are run sequentially; however, this sequence may be changed by certain Actions, like Conditionals and Loops. Conditionals modify the Processâ€™ behavior based on certain conditions, while loops enable the repetition of certain Actions.

Functions can be used to organize and reuse parts of a Process more easily.
The Designer allows users to extensively test and troubleshoot a Process during development.

Controls and Images can be used to enable interaction with third-party applications, web pages, or images on the monitor.

To deal with unexpected circumstances, Exception Handling rules can be set up. These may apply to individual Actions, or even blocks of Actions.
