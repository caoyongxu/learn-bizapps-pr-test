During Process development, it is important to test the behavior of the Process and ensure that everything is working as expected – and if not, to locate and diagnose the underlying issues.

## Testing

Processes under development can be run at any time in the Process Designer, through the **Start** button; during this run, the current Action is highlighted, giving users a clear view of the run progress.

It is possible to pause, resume, and stop the process; it is also possible to run one Action at a time, to closely examine the behavior of the Process in certain sections. This is all achieved using the respective buttons:

Breakpoints can be added to automatically pause the run when a specific Action is reached; this is done by clicking to the left of the Action in question:

By right-clicking on any Action, users may start running the Process directly from that point onward; this enables them to test specific parts of a Process without having to run it in its entirety.

On the bottom-right corner of the Designer, the Variables pane contains all the variables used in the Process, their type, and their current value. This information changes in real time, providing users a clear picture of the Process’ state at any given time. Values can even be changed manually while the process is running, enabling detailed and efficient testing.

## Debugging

In addition to the above, certain features are designed specifically for locating and correcting errors.
Any design-time errors – errors that are identifiable before the Process is run – are communicated through red **X** symbols in the Designer, while details can also be found in the Errors pane at the bottom of the Designer:

In this example, two required fields were left blank, so the relevant Action is highlighted as erroneous, and the Errors Pane contains further details.

Runtime errors – errors that occur while a process is running – are communicated in a similar fashion:

An incorrect value was passed as an Excel column; while trying to read from that column, the Process failed. The Action in question is highlighted, and the Errors Pane contains more detailed information on the error.
