In process development, the order in which actions and functions are executed when a process runs is called **Process Flow**. Controlling the flow is essential for complex processes with multiple functions and error handling.

By using flow control Actions in WinAutomation, users can direct the process flow as necessary, allowing for more efficient development. 

The ability to adjust the flow is critical and enables developers to create robust and more efficient processes. They can implement functionality in case of exceptions and skip unnecessary steps when they are not needed.  

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Learn how the process flow works
* Learn how to use the Flow Control group of Actions to direct and manipulate the flow

## Prerequisites

* Basic Familiarity with WinAutomation
