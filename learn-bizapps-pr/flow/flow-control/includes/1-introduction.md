In process development, the order in which actions and functions are implemented when a process runs is called a process flow. Controlling the flow is essential for complex processes with multiple functions and error handling.

By using flow control actions in WinAutomation, users can direct the process flow as necessary, allowing for more efficient development. 

The ability to adjust the flow is critical and enables developers to create robust and more efficient processes. Accordingly, developers can implement functionality when working with exceptions and then skip the unnecessary steps.  

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how the process flow works.
- Learn how to use the flow control group of actions to direct and manipulate the flow.

## Prerequisites

To complete this module successfully, you should have basic familiarity with WinAutomation.
