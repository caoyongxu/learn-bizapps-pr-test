Of course we have an app -- the Microsoft Flow mobile app! From this app, you can access these features:

- Activity Feed
- Browsing
- Buttons
- Managing Flows

First, you'll need to download and install the Microsoft Flow mobile app from your app store.

After it's installed, start it and sign in.

When you first start the app, you'll see the Activity Feed. The Activity Feed is the place to see what's happening with your flows. It won't be the full experience you'd expect from your PC, but it will show you useful details.

For example, you'll see a flow's last activity, as shown here. You can see whether the flow succeeded or failed. If it failed, you'll see which step it failed on.

## How button flows are started
Buttons are flows that are started through a manual action. For example, you can create a button to send a *Working from home today* email to your manager. If you live far from your workplace, you can then use this button on days when the traffic is a mess!

- Select **Buttons** to use some of these flows.

- Select **Browse** to check out templates for more button flows that you can add to your collection.
