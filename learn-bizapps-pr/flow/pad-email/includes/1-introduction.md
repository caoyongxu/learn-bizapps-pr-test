Standardized email messages are common in most business organizations. Automated responses are essential for customer support, while email management is critical for virtually any department. 

Email automation enables organizations to send personalized emails to customers or employees efficiently. Uniformity in business communication is critical and ensures that all employees follow the same communication standards.

Accordingly, Power Automate Desktop provides various actions that enable email handling for webmail services, Microsoft Outlook, and Exchange servers.

Using email actions, you can automate any webmail service, like Outlook.com, that supports the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) protocols. 

To use the Outlook actions, you have to install the respective software, while the Exchange actions require an existed Exchange server.
