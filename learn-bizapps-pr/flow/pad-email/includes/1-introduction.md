Standardized email messages are common in most business organizations. Automated responses are essential for customer support, while email management is critical for virtually any department.

Email automation enables organizations to send personalized emails to customers and employees efficiently. Uniformity in business communication is critical and ensures that all employees follow the same communication standards.

Power Automate Desktop provides various actions that enable email handling for webmail services, Microsoft Outlook, and Exchange servers.

Using the email actions, you can automate any webmail service that supports the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), such as Outlook.com.
