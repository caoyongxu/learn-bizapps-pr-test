  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You've hardcoded a value in a cloud flow action and want to have a different value override it in other environments. What should you do to resolve the problem while maintaining a healthy ALM? 
    choices: 
    - content: Edit the flow after deployment to each environment.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Editing a cloud flow outside of a development environment doesn't maintain a healthy ALM. An environment variable would let you establish a default value and then override it in each environment where the flow is deployed to.
    - content: Use an environment variable.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. An environment variable would let you establish a default value and then override it in each environment where the flow is deployed to.
    - content: Use a connection reference. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. A connection reference wouldn't help with a hard-coded value. An environment variable would let you establish a default value and then override it in each environment where the flow is deployed to.
    - content: Export the solution as Managed. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Exporting a solution as Managed or Unmanaged has no impact on having different values in each environment. An environment variable would let you establish a default value and then override it in each environment where the flow is deployed to.
  - content: You're exporting a solution to transport it to a non-development environment. When prompted for Export as type, which option should you choose? 
    choices: 
    - content: Unmanaged
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Solutions should be transported to non-development environments by using managed solutions.
    - content: Backup
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Backup isn't a valid Export as type; only Managed and Unmanaged are. Solutions should be transported to non-development environments by using managed solutions.
    - content: Managed
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Solutions should be transported to non-development environments by using managed solutions.
  - content: Which of the following options is not a benefit of using solutions with cloud flows? 
    choices: 
    - content: Using solutions makes cloud flows run faster. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Cloud flows run the same speed whether in a solution or not.
    - content: Solutions act as a container to make it easier to manage related resources, including cloud flows. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This option describes a benefit of using solutions.
    - content: Solutions can be exported and stored in source control for version tracking. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This option describes a benefit of using solutions.
    - content: Solutions enable the transport of the collection of resources from one environment to another with straightforward export and import actions. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This option describes a benefit of using solutions.
