Thisâ€¯module explored how you can use solutions to manage, and transport cloud flows between Power Platform environments. Solutions are the Power Platform mechanism for implementing [Application Life Cycle Management](/power-platform/alm/?azure-portal=true) (ALM) for Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. Using solutions enable the transport of the collection of resources from one environment to another with simple export and import actions. Cloud flows in solutions use connection references making them less dependent on the environment connection instance and easier to transport. Environment variables allow cloud flows to have unique configurations in each environment the solution is deployed. You can also export solutions to store them unpacked in source control as part of a healthy ALM practice.
