The approval action provides the flexibility to approve or reject across various platforms. This section will focus on four of them.

## How to respond from Microsoft Outlook

**Power Automate Approval** connector gives you the flexibility to approve directly from **Microsoft Outlook**. This works for both the approve and reject and also for custom responses.

After the approval is made the email body automatically updates to the following thereby making sure, you do not approve or reject multiple times.

## How to respond from Power Automate via internet browser

**Microsoft Outlook** gives you the flexibility to access **Outlook Web Apps** via the browser and accept the approvals from there as well.

Just like the desktop Outlook client, you have the flexibility to add a comment from the browser.

And once the approval process has been completed the email body automatically updates to the following thereby making sure you do not approve or reject multiple times.

In addition, you can log into <https://flow.microsoft.com>, select the **Actions items,** and select **Approvals**. In **Received,** you will see the item that is pending your approval.
