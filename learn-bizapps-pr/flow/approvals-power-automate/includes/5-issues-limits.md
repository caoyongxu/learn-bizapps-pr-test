Approvals timestamps will always be shown in UTC. If you see in the screenshots below, the completion date is added to a compose action to display what the date format is. When the flow runs, the date is in the UTC format.

## Approval wait time duration

The Approval wait time duration is dependent on the duration of the entire flow. Run duration is calculated by using a run's start time. This includes flows with pending steps like approvals. After 30 days, any pending steps time-out. For more information on duration, see the links Summary Unit at the end of this module.
