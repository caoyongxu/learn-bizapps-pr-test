Approval in Power Automate can help you automate sign off requests and combine human decision-making with background automation to help business users focus on their core tasks. Using Power Automate you can set up workflows that have multiple approvals set up in a sequential or parallel manner according to requirements. You also have the flexibility to add out-of-box responses, which are accept and reject, or you can add your own responses to customize the workflow for your business need.
