The **Create an approval** action starts an automated approval process but doesn't wait for the approval to complete. You can cancel the approval.

If you want to wait for a response, the **Create an approval** action can be paired with the **Wait for an approval** action.

Four types of approval actions are available in the **Create an approval** action, and they can be summarized into two categories: **Approve/Reject** and **Custom Responses**.

The following screenshot shows the two **Approve/Reject** categories side by side. The categories appear similar; however, they have one key difference, which is the number of approvals that are required to complete the action. As their names suggest, the **Everyone must approve** type will wait for everyone to approve, and the **First to respond** type requires only one approval.

In the **Assigned to** field, you can add the email addresses of the approvers, which you can separate with a semicolon (**;**).

The following image provides a closer look at the advanced settings. The settings include the ability to link to a description, add attachments, and even assign a requestor who is sending this approval request.

**Approve** and **Reject** are the out-of-the-box response options that are available. With **Custom Responses**, you can add your own options. In the **Response options Item** field, you can add your options.

The following figure shows two **Custom Responses** categories side by side. The categories appear similar; however, they have one key difference, which is the number of approvals that are required to complete the action. As the names suggest, the **Wait for all responses** type will wait for all responses, and the **Wait for one response** type requires only one response.
