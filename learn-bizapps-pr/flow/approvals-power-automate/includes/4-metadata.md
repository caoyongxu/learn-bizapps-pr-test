Actions in the **Approvals** connector for Power Automate provide several helpful metadata items.

## Who is approved or rejected

After an item has been approved or rejected, all metadata that is part of this process is available for other workflow processes. The following screenshot shows the primary dynamic content that captures the information.

The **Outcome** option will provide you with the approval option that was was selected, which will likely be **Approve**, **Reject**, or custom responses that you might have added.

## Date and time stamps of the approvals

Several dates and time stamps are automatically captured by approval. The following screenshot shows all dates that are captured.
