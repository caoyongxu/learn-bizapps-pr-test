To enable users to prevent simultaneous access to resources, WinAutomation provides the **Synchronization** actions.

This group of actions contains the **Lock Handle** and the **Release Handle** actions that indicate the start and the end of a  locked region. The actions inside the locked region cannot be executed simultaneously in different instances of the process.
