To help users prevent simultaneous access to resources, WinAutomation provides synchronization actions.

This group of actions contains the **Lock Handle** and the **Release Handle** actions that indicate the start and the end of a  locked region. The actions inside the locked region can't be run simultaneously in different instances of the process.
