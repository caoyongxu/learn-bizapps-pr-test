WinAutomation supports parallel execution of many instances of the same process. Although parallel execution is a powerful concept in process development,  simultaneous access to resources isn't always wanted. 

Allowing multiple processes to access resources like mouse and keyboard or restricted files at the same time can alter each process's result. 

**Synchronization** actions enable you to prevent actions from being executed simultaneously in multiple process instances. When a process instance runs the specified actions, the rest of the instances have to wait.

## Learning objectives

 In this module, you will: 

- Understand in which cases parallel execution must be prevented.
- Configure the synchronization actions.
- Create a process with synchronization actions to prevent simultaneous access to a file. 

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with the WinAutomation console and process designer.
- Basic familiarity with process development and variables.
