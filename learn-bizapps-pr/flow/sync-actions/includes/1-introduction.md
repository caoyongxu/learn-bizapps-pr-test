WinAutomation supports parallel implementation of many instances of the same process. Though parallel implementation is a powerful concept in process development, simultaneous access to resources isn't always wanted. 

Allowing multiple processes to simultaneously access resources, such as a mouse and keyboard or restricted files, can alter each process's result. 

Synchronization actions enable you to prevent actions from being run simultaneously in multiple process instances. When a process instance runs the specified actions, the rest of the instances have to wait.

## Learning objectives

 In this module, you will: 

- Learn when to prevent parallel implementation.
- Configure synchronization actions.
- Create a process with synchronization actions to prevent simultaneous access to a file. 

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this module, you should have basic familiarity with the WinAutomation console and process designer, in addition to familiarity with process development and variables.
