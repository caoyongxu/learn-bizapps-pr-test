To inspect all occurred events on the platform, go to the **Logs** tab of the **WinAutomation Console**. This tab displays all log registries and enables you to filter them based on type and date.

The logs are categorized into three distinctive types according to severity:

- Info
- Warning
- Error

Through the respective options, you can hide some of the event types to help make the inspection easier.

- Today
- Yesterday
- Last seven days
- This month
- Last month
- Custom (where you can define a custom range of dates)
