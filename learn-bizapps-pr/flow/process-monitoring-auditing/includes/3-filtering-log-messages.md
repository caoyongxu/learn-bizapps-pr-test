To inspect all occurred events on the platform, go to the **Logs** tab of the **WinAutomation Console**. This tab displays all log registries and enables you to filter them based on type and date.

The logs are categorized into three distinctive types according to severity:

- Info
- Warning
- Error

Through the respective options, you can hide some of the event types to help make the inspection easier.

To filter the displayed logs based on their date, select the calendar icon on the toolbar and then set a date range. You can choose between the following options:

- Today
- Yesterday
- Last seven days
- This month
- Last month
- Custom (where you can define a custom range of dates)

You can enable the **Server** option to display logs regarding the platform and WinAutomation in general.
