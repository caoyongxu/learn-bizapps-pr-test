To inspect all the platform's occurred events, navigate to the **Logs** tab of the **Console**. This tab displays all the log registries and enables the filtering of them based on type and date.

The logs are categorized into three distinctive types according to their severity:

- Info
- Warning
- Error

Through the respective options, you can hide some of the event types to make the inspection easier.
