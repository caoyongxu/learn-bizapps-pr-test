After you have filtered the logs, go to the main logs pane to view detailed information about them. More precisely, this pane displays:

- The type of event. 
- The date and time that the event was recorded.
- The source of the event, which can be the server, user agent, machine agent, or a specific process.
- The message of the event.
- The external ID and the execution ID of the event.
- The screenshot that was taken, if the **Error Handling** option is enabled.

When an error occurs in a process, the Details pane displays the process name, the function that contains the failed action, and its number.
