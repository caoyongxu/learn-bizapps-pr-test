After you have filtered the logs, go to the main logs pane to view detailed information about them. More precisely, this pane displays:

- The type of event.
- The date and time that the event was recorded.
- The source of the event, which can be the server, user agent, machine agent, or a specific process.
- The message of the event.
- The external ID and the execution ID of the event.
- The screenshot that was taken, if the **Error Handling** option is enabled.

To reveal further information about a particular log, select the log and then review the Details pane.

When an error occurs in a process, the Details pane displays the process name, the function that contains the failed action, and its number.

When a group of logs has been reviewed and are no longer needed, use the **Archive** button to save them into a separate **.dat** file. This option removes the selected records from the database.
