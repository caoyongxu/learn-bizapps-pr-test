Logging is the act of keeping records (logs) of events that occur while an application runs. 

WinAutomation records all the vital information about processes, and the platform itself, into a central log file. Through logs, users can ensure processes run as expected and discover the source of thrown errors. 

All the logs are displayed in the **Logs** tab of the **Console**
