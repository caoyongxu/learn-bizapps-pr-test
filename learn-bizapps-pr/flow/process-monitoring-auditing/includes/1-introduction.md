Logging is the act of keeping records (logs) of events that occur while an application runs. 

WinAutomation records all vital information about processes and the platform into a central log file. Through logs, users can ensure that processes run as expected and discover the source of thrown errors. 

All logs are displayed in the **Logs** tab of the **WinAutomation Console**
