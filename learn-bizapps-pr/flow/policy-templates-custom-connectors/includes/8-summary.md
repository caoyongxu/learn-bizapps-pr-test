This module explored how applying policies allow you to modify a custom connectorâ€™s behavior at runtime.  You saw how you could use policies to perform data conversion, route requests, set parameter values, and more.  By configuring policy templates, policies apply to triggers and actions.  Using expressions, you included data from the query parameters, headers, and connection properties in the policy templates. Applying policies allows you to adapt what the API expects as input and sends as responses to improve the maker experience using the connector.
