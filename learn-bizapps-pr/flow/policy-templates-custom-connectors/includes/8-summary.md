This module explored how applying policies will allow you to modify a custom connectorâ€™s behavior at runtime. You discovered how you can use policies to perform data conversion, route requests, set parameter values, and more. By configuring policy templates, policies will apply to triggers and actions. You used expressions to include data from the query parameters, headers, and connection properties in the policy templates. Applying policies allows you to adapt what the API expects as input and sends as responses to improve the maker experience when using the connector.
