In this unit, we will develop a simple process that creates a folder called Records if it does not already exist.

To create a process:

1. Launch WinAutomation.

2. Select the **New Process** button.

4. Add a **Get Special Folder** action in the Workspace to get the path for your Desktop folder.

5. Add an **If Folder Exists** action to check whether the **Records** folder exists.

6. Between the **If Folder Exists** and the **End If** actions, add a **Create Folder** action to create a folder named **Records** inside the Desktop Folder.

7. Select the **Run** button to verify that your process runs as expected. A folder named **Records** must be created in your Desktop.

8. In case you want to check how every single action is run, you can run the process step by step by using the Execute Next Action button.

9. Select **Save** and close the process designer.

10. Now, you can run your process manually through the **Run** button in the console toolbar.

11. While the process is running, a Notification popup window will be displayed to inform you about the running process.  

    ![Screenshot of the Notification Popup Window.](..\media\image-26.png)

12. If you want to cancel the execution of the process, you can press the **Stop** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Stop button in the console.](..\media\image-27.png)

13. In case you want to run the process at specific days automatically, navigate to the **Scheduler** tab.

    ![Screenshot of the Scheduler tab in the console.](..\media\image-28.png)

14. Select **New** and select **Schedule**.

    ![Screenshot of the New option in the Scheduler tab.](..\media\image-29.png)

15. Now, configure the fields according to your needs. For example, to run the process automatically every Monday and Friday, set the fields like the image below.

16. In case you want to use a trigger instead of a schedule to run the process automatically, navigate to the **Triggers** tab.

    ![Screenshot of the Triggers tab in the console.](..\media\image-31.png)

17. Select **New** and select the type of trigger you want to deploy.

    ![Screenshot of the New option in the Triggers tab.](..\media\image-32.png)

18. In this example, we created a **HotKey Trigger** that runs the process every time the **CTRL + F10** key combination is pressed.
