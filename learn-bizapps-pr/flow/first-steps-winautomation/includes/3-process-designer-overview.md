To manually develop a WinAutomation process, you have to use the process designer. The process designer is the platform's primary development tool and allows you to create processes using actions. 

The process designer consists of seven panes that enable you to handle every aspect of the development process.

The two most essential panes are the Actions Pane and the Workspace. The Actions Pane displays all the available actions that can be deployed in your process, while the Workspace is the area where the development happens.

The pane in the top right corner of the process designer is called Functions and enables you to create new functions or manage the existing ones.  

> [!NOTE]
> A function is a group of actions that can be accessed as one entity through the chosen name. Functions are used to make processes more readable by splitting them into parts.

Below the Function Pane, you can find the Variables Pane that displays information about the used variables and their current value. Through this pane, you can rename variables or see where they have been used.

On the bottom part of the process designer, you can find the Controls and the Images Repositories.

The Controls Repository holds all the controls from Windows and web automation actions. All the UI elements that your process will access, such as buttons and checkboxes, will be stored here.

The Images Repository holds all the images used in actions. All the images used by your process will be stored in the Images Repository.

The last process designerâ€™s Pane is the Errors Pane, which displays information about the occurred errors in your process.
