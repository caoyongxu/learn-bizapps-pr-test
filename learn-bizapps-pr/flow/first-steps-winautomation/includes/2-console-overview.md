When you launch WinAutomation, the first window that appears on your screen is called **Console**. The **Console** is the main component of the platform and enables you to configure various options or start other components. 

It consists of five tabs that handle different aspects of the platform, such as processes, triggers and schedules.

The first tab of the **Console** is the **Processes** tab. This tab allows you to manage your process and perform all the needed actions on them.

All your processes can be organized into folders through the **Folders Pane** on the left side of the tab.

Through the **Processes Pane**, you can select processes and perform various operations on them, such as running, copying, deleting or disabling them. All the available actions can be found on the **Toolbar**.

Next to the **Processes** tab, there is the **Triggers** tab that provides all the necessary functionality to create, manage and deploy triggers. Triggers allow you to run processes automatically without your interference.

WinAutomation offers 11 different kinds of triggers that cover the most common automation scenarios. More information can be found on th [respective documentation page](https://docs.winautomation.com/en/triggers.html).

The third tab of the **Console** is the **Scheduler** tab that enables you to create and manage schedules. Schedules allow you to automatically run processes at specific days/times or keep them running in time intervals.
