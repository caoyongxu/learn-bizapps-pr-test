Using standardized text and data formats is a widespread practice across enterprises, ensuring the integrity and the readability of data. Maintaining uniformity in numerical, text and date values is of paramount importance, especially in areas such as finance and logistics. 

Furthermore, text manipulation and parsing are crucial to data extraction and process formalization. Converting data in the same patterned formats guarantees the expected process' behavior and improves the cooperation between different data handling procedures.

In business environments, Excel registries, databases and reports require identical data formats in order to make information more accessible and enable users to search for it in a faster and more effective way.
