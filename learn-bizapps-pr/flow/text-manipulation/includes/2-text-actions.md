Use the **Get Text Length** action to determine the length of a text value or a list of text values. The action measures the number of characters in the text value.

> [!NOTE]
> An alternative way to retrieve the length of a text variable is to use the following syntax:
> %Text%.length

With the **Append Line to Text** action, you can add a line of text to a single text value or list of text values. The result is stored in a new text variable.

![Screenshot of the append line to text action properties.](..\media\append-line-to-text-action-properties.png)

Use the **Get Subtext** action to retrieve a specific portion of a text or list of text values. Set the **Start Index** property to retrieve text starting at a character position or at the start of the text, and set the **Length** property to end at another position or at the end of the text. The action stores its output in a text variable.

The **Pad Text** action can add whitespace, a word, or a phrase before or after a text or a list so that the resulting text reaches a specified length. The text to pad, or the text that is used to pad the text, can be entered as variables. The padded text is stored in a text variable.

Use the **Trim Text** action to remove whitespace from the beginning of a text string, at the end of a text string, or both.

![Screenshot of the trim text action properties.](..\media\trim-text-action-properties.png)

With the **Change Text Case** action, you can change the text case that is found in a single text value or list of text values. The new text will be stored in a separate text variable.

# Text, dates, and numbers

Four text actions are dedicated to converting text values to and from the number and **DateTime** data types. Certain scenarios can occur where data that includes numbers has been extracted from a source, such as a spreadsheet or webpage, and has been stored as a datatable, datarow, or even a text value, but it must be entered as a numerical value elsewhere.

For example, data is extracted from multiple columns of an Excel sheet into a **DataTable** type variable. Some of the columns contain text values, while others contain numbers. The numbers must be entered into multiple drop-down fields in a desktop application. The numbers must be stored as numerical values; otherwise, the data will not be processed correctly and can't be entered.

To ensure that numbers are stored as numerical values, use the **Convert Text to Number** action. This action requires as input single text items, text list items, datarow items, or datatable items. Regarding the list, datarow, or datatable items, the itemâ€™s index must be specified.

![Screenshot of the convert text to number action properties.](..\media\convert-text-to-number-action-properties.png)

Use the **Convert Number to Text** action to achieve the reverse conversion. Enter a number or a numeric variable to convert to a text variable. Set the number of decimal places to include, and to configure, the digit grouping options.

Use the **Convert DateTime to Text** action to convert a datetime value to text. This action's properties contain several options regarding the format of the datetime input. The most straightforward way to use the action is to enter a **DateTime** variable that was created through the platform that was created with the **Get Current Date and Time** action.

By using this approach, the datetime value is guaranteed to be in a recognizable format. Alternatively, a custom value can be used as input. In this case, the user must ensure that it is entered in a compatible datetime format. The action can be configured to save datetime as text by using one of the available formats or a custom format.

![Screenshot of the convert datetime to text action properties.](..\media\convert-datetime-to-text-action-properties.png)

Use the **Convert Text to DateTime** action to achieve the reverse conversion. Enter a text value or variable that uses a compatible datetime format. If the value that was entered uses a custom format, select the **Date is represented in custom format** check box in the properties and then define the custom format in the field that appears underneath.

## Date formatting

When displayed on their own, the following characters produce the following formats.

## Additional text actions

The **Create Random Text** action is ideal for generating passwords because it can be configured to generate text of a certain length and include uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

![Screenshot of the create random text action properties.](..\media\create-random-text-action-properties.png)

To combine a list of text values into a single text value, use the **Join Text** action and then enter a list variable as its input. Determine if the list items should be separated by using a delimiter, such as a space. If the list items will be separated, choose from one of the standard delimiters or specify a custom delimiter.

![Screenshot of the join text action properties.](..\media\join-text-action-properties.png)

To separate a single text value into a list of items, use the **Split Text** action. Enter a value or a text variable as the input. Ideally, the text should include recognizable delimiters that separate the items. Select one of the standard delimiters or enter a custom delimiter.

With the **Parse Text** action, you can search a text value for a specific string of text. Set the action to search for the first occurrence, or all occurrences, of the text string. Optionally, you can set the action to **Ignore Case** (thus making the search case-insensitive). The output of the action stores the position, or list of positions, as a numerical value (or list of numerical values) that indicates the position(s) where the search string was found in the text.

![Screenshot of the parse text action properties.](..\media\parse-text-action-properties.png)

If the search string is not known beforehand, you can search for a regular expression. Select the **Is Regular Expression** check box to store the matched string of a regular expression in a new variable.

![Screenshot of the parse text properties regex.](..\media\parse-text-properties-regex.png)

The **Replace Text** action can find a string in a text and replace it with another string or character. The **Text to Parse**, **Text to Find**, and **Replacement Text** are required inputs. Similar to the **Parse Text** action, the search can be configured to be case-insensitive, and regular expressions can be used for the search. Escape sequences enable the user to add characters, such as a tab or a new line, into the replacement text.

![Screenshot of the replace text action properties.](..\media\replace-text-action-properties.png)

The **Escape Text for Regular Expression** action can modify a regular expression so that the characters that are used in regular expressions are escaped and are treated as literal characters in the string. This action can be useful if a regular expression contains a variable with a text value. It can be used to escape the value in the variable, ensuring that the regular expression handles all characters in the text.
