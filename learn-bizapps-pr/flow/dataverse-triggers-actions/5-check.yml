    choices: 
    - content: When a record is created
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Because you don't know where the user might be performing this action, you can't request additional input through the trigger.
    - content: When a record is updated
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Because you don't know where the user might be performing this action, you can't request additional input through the trigger.
    - content: When a record is deleted
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Because you don't know where the user might be performing this action, you can't request additional input through the trigger.
    - content: When a record is selected
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Because this action begins as a button in Dataverse, you can request additional input from the user.
  - content: What does the List records action do?
    choices: 
    - content: Fetches child items
      isCorrect: false

    - content: Fetches multiple records in a Dataverse table, which can be filtered according to a logical condition
