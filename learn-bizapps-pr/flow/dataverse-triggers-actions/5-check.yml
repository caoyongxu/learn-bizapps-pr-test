      explanation: Your flow will always start with a trigger followed by one or more actions.
    - content: There is no difference; actions and triggers are synonymous.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Triggers and actions are different.
    - content: Actions start a flow, triggers are performed in a flow.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Try the reverse.
    - content: Triggers are used for Dataverse, actions are used for other connectors.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Both triggers and actions are used for Dataverse and other connectors.
  - content: Which trigger allows for additional inputs?
    choices: 
    - content: When a record is created
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Since you don't know where the user may be performing this action, you cannot request additional input through the trigger.
    - content: When a record is updated
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Since you don't know where the user may be performing this action, you cannot request additional input through the trigger.
    - content: When a record is deleted
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Since you don't know where the user may be performing this action, you cannot request additional input through the trigger.
    - content: When a record is selected
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Since this action begins as a button in Dataverse, you can request additional input from the user.
  - content: What does the action list records do?
    choices: 
    - content: It fetches child items.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While it can be used for this, 'list records' is not limited to only this scenario.
    - content: It fetches multiple records in a Dataverse table, which can be filtered according to a logical condition.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: One scenario would be fetching all items related to another record in the same or a different table.
    - content: It fetches all versions of a row of data.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The 'list records' action does not fetch versions.
