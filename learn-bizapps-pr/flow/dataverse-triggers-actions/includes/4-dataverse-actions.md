While triggers start a flow in Power Automate, actions are exactly what they sound like: actions that the flow will perform when triggered.

The Dataverse actions are:

- **Add a new row** - This action allows you to add a new row in the selected Microsoft Dataverse table.

- **Delete a row** - This action allows you to delete a row from a Microsoft Dataverse table.

- **Download a file or an image** - This action allows you to download a file or an image content from a Microsoft Dataverse table.

- **Get a row by ID** - This action allows you to get the row that matches an ID in a Microsoft Dataverse table.

- **List rows** - This action allows you to list the rows in a Microsoft Dataverse table that match the selected options.

- **Perform a bound action** - This action allows you to perform Microsoft Dataverse actions associated with a selected table.

- **Perform an unbound action** - This action allows you to perform Microsoft Dataverse actions available in the environment that aren't associated with any table.

- **Relate rows** - This action allows you to link a row in one Microsoft Dataverse table to another if the tables have a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship.

- **Search rows (preview)** - This action allows you to search a Microsoft Dataverse environment using Relevance Search, and returns the rows that match the search term most closely.

- **Unrelate rows** - This action allows you to remove the link between a row in one Microsoft Dataverse table to another if the tables have a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship.

- **Update a row** - This action allows you to modify any selected row in a Microsoft Dataverse table, or adds a new row if it doesnâ€™t exist.

- **Upload a file or an image** - This action allows you to upload a file or an image content to a Microsoft Dataverse table with a compatible column type.

- **Perform a changeset request** - This action allows you to perform a group of Microsoft Dataverse connector operations as a single transaction. If one of the operations fails, all the successful actions are rolled back.

Dataverse actions in Power Automate allow you to create robust processes that surround your data.
