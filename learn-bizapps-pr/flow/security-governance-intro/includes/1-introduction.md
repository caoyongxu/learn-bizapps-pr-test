Power Automate provides organizations with the ability to automate
business processes using a drag-and-drop designer. The audience for
Power Automate is quite diverse and is often referred to as makers.
Whether you are an information worker who is familiar with Microsoft
Excel, or a professional developer building an application in Node.js,
Power Automate can be used to improve productivity through a low code
experience.

A powerful capability in Power Automate is connectors. Using connectors,
a maker can connect to a wide variety of applications and APIs without
having to understand security schemes, such as OAuth, in order to
establish a connection to these systems. There are currently more than
300 connectors available that are provided by Microsoft and third party
organizations.

With democratized access to building flows, organizations may have
concerns with makers connecting to unauthorized systems resulting in
leaking sensitive business information. For many organizations,
balancing increased productivity comes with additional risks and
exposure. However, Microsoft provides tools and guidance that
organizations can use to find the right balance between digital
transformation, that allows them to be more competitive in their
industry but without exposing sensitive data.
