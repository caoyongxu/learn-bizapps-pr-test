Microsoft Power Platform provides organizations with the ability to automate
business processes and create apps by using an intuitive drag-and-drop designer. The audience for
Microsoft Power Platform is diverse and is often referred to as makers.
Whether you are an information worker who is familiar with Microsoft
Excel or a professional developer who is building an application in Node.js,
Microsoft Power Platform can be used to improve productivity through a low code
experience.

A powerful capability in Microsoft Power Platform is connectors. By using connectors,
a maker can connect to a wide variety of applications and APIs without
having to understand security schemes, such as OAuth, to
establish a connection to these systems. Currently, more than
450 connectors are provided by Microsoft and third-party organizations.

With democratized access to building flows and apps, organizations might have
concerns with makers connecting to unauthorized systems, which could result in
the leaking of sensitive business information. For many organizations,
balancing increased productivity comes with other risks and
exposure. However, Microsoft provides tools and guidance that
organizations can use to find the right balance between digital
transformation, allowing them to be more competitive in their
industry without exposing sensitive data.
