Power Automate provides organizations with the ability to automate
business processes by using a drag-and-drop designer. The audience for
Power Automate is diverse and is often referred to as makers.
Whether you are an information worker who is familiar with Microsoft
Excel or a professional developer who is building an application in Node.js,
Power Automate can be used to improve productivity through a low code
experience.

A powerful capability in Power Automate is connectors. By using connectors,
a maker can connect to a wide variety of applications and APIs without
having to understand security schemes, such as OAuth, to
establish a connection to these systems. Currently, more than
300 connectors are provided by Microsoft and third-party organizations.

With democratized access to building flows, organizations might have
concerns with makers connecting to unauthorized systems, which could result in
the leaking of sensitive business information. For many organizations,
balancing increased productivity comes with additional risks and
exposure. However, Microsoft provides tools and guidance that
organizations can use to find the right balance between digital
transformation, allowing them to be more competitive in their
industry without exposing sensitive data.
