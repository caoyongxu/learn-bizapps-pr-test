In this module, we introduced many different Power Platform concepts
including Environments Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies and reviewed
many of the tools found in the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit.
All these features and tools are key in organizations governing their
environments. Since every organization has different governance needs,
these tools can be used selectively to implement the level of governance
required for your organization. In addition, while these tools do enable
governance, they can also be used to identify makers who are building
solutions that improve an organization's productivity. When these people
have been identified, organizations should look to further empower them
to extend their benefits to more parts of the organization.
