This module introduced many different Power Platform concepts,
including environments' Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, and reviewed
many of the tools that are found in the Center of Excellence (COE) Starter Kit.
All these features and tools are key to organizations governing their
environments.

Because every organization has different governance needs, these tools
can be used selectively to implement the level of governance
that is required for your organization. In addition, while these tools do enable
governance, they can also be used to identify makers who are building
solutions that improve an organization's productivity.

When these makers have been identified, organizations should look to
further empower them to extend their app development benefits to more
parts of the organization.
