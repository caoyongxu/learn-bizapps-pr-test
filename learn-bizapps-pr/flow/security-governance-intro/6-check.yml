  - content: When modifying a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy, how can an administrator know if they are about to break an existing app?
    choices: 
    - content: The new Power Platform Admin portal provides an experience that will automatically detect if a pending change to a DLP policy will break existing apps.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Breaking an existing app, due to a new DLP policy change will create a bad experience for app makers and users. However, using the DLP Strategy app can mitigate these issues by detecting changes before they are made. An experience also exists that allows the administrator to send an email within the app.
    - content: The DLP Strategy app, found within the Center of Excellence Starter Kit, includes functionality that will detect if a pending change to a DLP policy will break existing apps.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Breaking an existing app, due to a new DLP policy change will create a bad experience for app makers and users. However, using the DLP Strategy app can mitigate these issues by detecting changes before they are made. An experience also exists that allows the administrator to send an email within the app.
    - content: The Power Platform management connectors will automatically detect these breaking changes and notify the administrator.

      explanation: Breaking an existing app, due to a new DLP policy change will create a bad experience for app makers and users. However, using the DLP Strategy app can mitigate these issues by detecting changes before they are made. An experience also exists that allows the administrator to send an email within the app.
    - content: There is no way to automatically detect whether a pending DLP policy change will impact existing apps.

  - content: Within Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, what is the behavior of the default data group?
    choices: 
    - content: All new connectors that are introduced to an environment are placed here.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand as all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This may mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is sitting with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
    - content: Only new custom connectors are placed within the default data group when new custom connectors are added to an environment.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand as all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This may mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is sitting with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
    - content: Only new Microsoft connectors are placed within this data group when new Microsoft connectors are added to an environment.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand as all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This may mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is sitting with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
    - content: The default data group is only a guideline where new connectors should be placed when they are added to an environment.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand as all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This may mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is sitting with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
