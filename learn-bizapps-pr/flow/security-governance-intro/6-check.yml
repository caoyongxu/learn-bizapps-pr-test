  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Who can have access to the Power Apps and Power Automate default environment?
    choices: 
    - content: Only users that have been manually added by an environment administrator
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Administrators cannot restrict access to the default environment. Otherwise, users are likely to create resources outside of the visibility of administrators, which will mean that admins will no longer have any visibility or control of those resources.
    - content: Only users that have been manually added by a tenant administrator
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Administrators cannot restrict access to the default environment. Otherwise, users are likely to create resources outside of the visibility of administrators, which will mean that admins will no longer have any visibility or control of those resources.
    - content: Every user within the tenant
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Administrators cannot restrict access to the default environment. Otherwise, users are likely to create resources outside of the visibility of administrators, which will mean that admins will no longer have any visibility or control of those resources.
    - content: Every user within the tenant who has Power Apps according to the app plan
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Administrators cannot restrict access to the default environment. Otherwise, users are likely to create resources outside of the visibility of administrators, which will mean that admins will no longer have any visibility or control of those resources.
  - content: When modifying a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy, how can an administrator know if they are about to break an existing app?
    choices: 
    - content: The new Microsoft Power Platform Admin portal provides an experience that will automatically detect if a pending change to a DLP policy will break existing apps.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Breaking an existing app due to a new DLP policy change will create a negative experience for app makers and users. However, using the DLP Strategy app can mitigate these issues by detecting changes before they are made. An experience also exists that allows the administrator to send an email within the app.
    - content: The DLP Strategy app, found within the Center of Excellence Starter Kit, includes functionality that will detect if a pending change to a DLP policy will break existing apps.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Breaking an existing app due to a new DLP policy change will create a negative experience for app makers and users. However, using the DLP Strategy app can mitigate these issues by detecting changes before they are made. An experience also exists that allows the administrator to send an email within the app.
    - content: Microsoft Power Platform management connectors will automatically detect these breaking changes and notify the administrator.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Breaking an existing app due to a new DLP policy change will create a negative experience for app makers and users. However, using the DLP Strategy app can mitigate these issues by detecting changes before they are made. An experience also exists that allows the administrator to send an email within the app.
    - content: There is no way to automatically detect whether a pending DLP policy change will impact existing apps.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Breaking an existing app due to a new DLP policy change will create a negative experience for app makers and users. However, using the DLP Strategy app can mitigate these issues by detecting changes before they are made. An experience also exists that allows the administrator to send an email within the app.
  - content: Within Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, what is the behavior of the default data group?
    choices: 
    - content: All new connectors that are introduced to an environment are placed in the default data group.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand because all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This approach might mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is positioned with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
    - content: Only new custom connectors are placed within the default data group when new custom connectors are added to an environment.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand because all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This approach might mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is positioned with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
    - content: Only new Microsoft connectors are placed within this data group when new Microsoft connectors are added to an environment.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand because all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This approach might mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is positioned with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
    - content: The default data group is only a guideline where new connectors should be placed when they are added to an environment.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Default data groups are important to understand because all new connectors will be placed into this data group when they are added to an environment. This approach might mean that a connector that would ordinarily be deemed suitable for business purposes is positioned with non-business data connectors and could inadvertently leak data to a non-sanctioned application or service.
