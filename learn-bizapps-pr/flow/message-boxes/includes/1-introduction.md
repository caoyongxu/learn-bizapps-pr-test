In attended automation, there are many tasks in which a user must interact with their workstation; this interaction can take the form of the user providing input (through text, buttons, checkboxes, forms etc.), or receiving output (through on-screen messages).

For example, consider the case of employee onboarding, a task that takes place across multiple systems and departments (HR, IT, etc.): the data regarding new employees must be provided as input, and it’s not unusual for users to enter such data manually. For a user to do so, a dialog box should appear, containing the necessary fields for the user to enter all the required data. Similarly, when a result must be brought to the attention of a user, a notification window should appear, displaying the relevant information.

In this module, you will learn about the use of message boxes, and how they can be used to request input from, or provide output to, the user. You will also create a custom message window to enable user input tailored to the needs of the process.

By the end of this module, you will be able to deploy the appropriate message boxes in automated Processes, to facilitate communication between users and Processes.
