It is important to note that there are actions in the SharePoint connector that can also create, edit, and delete items without using a single line of code. However, this HTTP method makes it easy to filter and identify the items in a single action.

The SharePoint connector's **Send an HTTP request to SharePoint** is the primary focus of this module. A premium connector name HTTP also exists which can also be used to perform similar actions.
