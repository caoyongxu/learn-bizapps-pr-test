Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the communication process that you use to browse to an internet site. Simplistically, when you visit a website, your browser makes an HTTP request to a server and that server responds with information that is displayed by your browser. Every HTTP connection essentially includes a request and a response.

Uniform resource locator (URL) is a web address that is used to identify the location. 

Every HTTP request must have a URL address and the request method. The four main HTTP methods are: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. These methods directly correspond to actions such as read, update, create, and delete.
