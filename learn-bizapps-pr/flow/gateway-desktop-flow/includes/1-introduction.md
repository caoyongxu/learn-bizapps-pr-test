Microsoft Power Automate Desktop allows you to automate actions that are required in your daily business processes that use desktop applications that are not hosted on the cloud. However, you might have business processes that use desktop applications and cloud services. Combining desktop flows with cloud flows allows you to take advantage of both opportunities. With Power Automate Desktop, you can take information from services like Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Outlook into legacy applications by configuring a gateway to your desktop.

In this module, you will:

-   Create a cloud flow.

-   Configure the on-premises data gateway to enable the cloud flow to run the desktop flow on your device.

-   Add the desktop flow to the new cloud flow.

-   Test the new cloud flow.
