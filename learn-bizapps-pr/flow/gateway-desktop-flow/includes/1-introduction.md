Power Automate Desktop allows you to automate actions required in your day-to-day business process, which use desktop applications not hosted on the cloud. However, you may have business processes, which utilize both desktop applications and cloud services. Combining desktop flows with cloud flows allows you to have the best of both worlds. Take information from services like Teams or Outlook into legacy applications easily by configuring a gateway to your desktop.

In this module, you will:

-   Create a cloud flow

-   Configure the on-premises data gateway to enable the cloud flow to execute the desktop flow on your device

-   Add the desktop flow to this new cloud flow

-   Perform a test run of the new cloud flow
