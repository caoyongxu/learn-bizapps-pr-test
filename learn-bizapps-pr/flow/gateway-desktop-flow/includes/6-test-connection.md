The easiest way to build out Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is to take one small step at a time and build and test that step. First, you created the desktop flow to perform actions on the invoicing app. Next, you created the input and output variables, or the information that would change every time the flow ran. Now, you have configured a gateway and built a cloud flow that will allow you to connect to the other resources, which exist in your organization. Let's test these connections to ensure everything is performing as expected.

Select **Test** at the top-right of the screen and then select **Manually** and **Test**.

After a moment, a green checkmark should appear by your flow to indicate that it is ready for testing. Select **Continue**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the continue button on the run flow window.](../media/continue.png)](../media/continue.png#lightbox)

Select **Run flow** and **Done** to watch your flow at work. The flow will appear with indications on each step to show you where your flow is in the process. Try not to interact with your mouse or keyboard while the flow is running as it may interrupt the process. When the testing is complete, you will see the following to denote that your flow ran successfully.

Now you have completed the process to build a cloud flow and connect it to a desktop flow via a gateway!
