Power Automate Desktop allows you to automate actions required in your day-to-day business process, which use desktop applications not hosted on the cloud. Now you know how to automate business processes, which utilize both desktop applications and cloud services. Combining desktop flows with cloud flows allows you to have the best of both worlds and dedicate your valuable time to more creative or strategic endeavors. Use these concepts to take information from services like Teams or Outlook into legacy applications easily.

-   Create a cloud flow

-   Configure the on-premises data gateway to enable the cloud flow to execute the desktop flow on your device

-   Add the desktop flow to this new cloud flow

-   Perform a test run of the new cloud flow

## Key takeaways

Here are the three key takeaways:

- Desktop flows run on a desktop and can access legacy applications.
- Cloud flows run in the cloud and can access online services and information.
