Power Automate Desktop allows you to automate actions that are required in your daily business processes that use desktop applications that are not hosted on the cloud. Now, you have learned how to automate business processes that use desktop applications and cloud services. Combining desktop flows with cloud flows allows you to take advantage of both so that you can dedicate your valuable time to more creative or strategic endeavors. You can use these concepts to take information from services like Teams or Outlook and bring them into legacy applications.

In this module, you learned how to:

-   Create a cloud flow.

-   Configure the on-premises data gateway to enable the cloud flow to run the desktop flow on your device.

-   Add the desktop flow to the new cloud flow.

-   Test the new cloud flow.

## Key takeaways

Three key takeaways from this module are:

- Desktop flows run on a desktop and can access legacy applications.
- Cloud flows run in the cloud and can access online services and information.
- Defining a gateway allows you to combine cloud and desktop flows to automate any process completely.
