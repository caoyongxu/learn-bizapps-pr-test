title: Connect a cloud flow to a desktop flow in Power Automate Desktop
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Gateways allow desktop flows to connect to other services and use robotic process automation (RPA) to its fullest potential. This module explains how to use those gateways as a foundation for integrating other technology with cloud flows.
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Create a cloud flow.
    - Configure the on-premises data gateway to enable the cloud flow to run the desktop flow on your device.
    - Add the desktop flow to the new cloud flow.
    - Test the new cloud flow.
prerequisites: Basic understanding of Microsoft Power Automate. This module builds from the Build your first Power Automate Desktop flow and the Use input and output parameters modules.
