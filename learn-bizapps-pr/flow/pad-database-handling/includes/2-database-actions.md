To connect to a database, use the **Open SQL Connection** action. This action only requires one input: the connection string. The **Connection String** field specifies all information that is necessary to connect to a database, such as the driver, the database, server names, and the username and password. 

SQL actions require a database connection. When the action connects to a database, it stores the connection into a SQL connection variable. To connect to a database, enter the string manually or as a variable.

Alternatively, use the connection string wizard:

1. Select **Build connections string** to open the **Data Link Properties** window. The data link tool helps the user compose the required connection string step by step. 

2. Once you access the wizard, select the correct driver for the database under the **Provider** tab.

3. Next, under the **Connection** tab, enter the remaining details such as the server name, the username, password, and database name. Select the **Test Connection** button to test that the connection string connects to a database successfully. Alternatively, copy a ready-made connection string.

4. Specify a connection timeout and additional network settings in the **Advanced** tab.

Query the database using the **Execute SQL Statement** action. Under **Get connection by** select ** Configure the action using the already established SQL connection and by setting the SQL connection variable that was created by the previous action. 

Alternatively, the action can connect to the database directly, with the method described in the **Open SQL Connection** action.

To terminate the connection to the database, use the **Close SQL Connection** action. The SQL connection variable is required.
