When designing flows, controlling the order in which actions and subflows are run is essential for complex flows with multiple functions and error handling.

By using flow control actions in Power Automate for desktop, users can direct the flow as necessary, allowing for more efficient development.

The ability to adjust the flow is critical and enables developers to create robust and more efficient flows. Accordingly, developers can implement functionality when working with exceptions and then skip the unnecessary steps.  

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how the flow works.
- Learn how to use the flow control group of actions to direct and manipulate the flow.

## Prerequisites

To complete this module successfully, you should have basic familiarity with Power Automate for desktop.
