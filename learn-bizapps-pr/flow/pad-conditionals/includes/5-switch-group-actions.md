The **Switch** group of actions is used when a flow's next steps depend on the value of a specific variable. Letâ€™s clarify this with an example.

The following flow retrieves a list of all the files in the **Documents** folder, and produces a file count based on 3 types of filenames: those containing the word **Payments**, those containing the word **Employees**, and those containing the word **Schedule**. A message containing the file counts is then displayed on the screen for the user to review.

First, we will retrieve the path to the Documents folder, retrieve all the files inside, and initialize four variables to act as file counters:

Because the files located in the Documents folder are stored in a list, we will use a **For Each** loop to iterate through each file:

![Screenshot with the For each action added.](..\media\for-each-action-added.png)

Now, each file must be checked for the required keywords. To achieve this, we will use a **Switch** action:

![Screenshot of the Switch action dialog with the Value to check set to current item.](..\media\switch-current-item.png)

![Screenshot with the Switch action added.](..\media\switch-action-added.png)

Next, we will add the alternative cases, using **Case** actions. The **Contains** comparison is used, since filenames may contain more characters than our keywords:

![Screenshot of the Case action dialog with Operator set to contains, and Value to compare set to payments.](..\media\case-contains-payments.png)

Eventually, the flow should look like this:

![Screenshot with the Cases added to the For Each action.](..\media\cases-added.png)

We will also add an unconditional alternative, in case some files contain none of our keywords:

![Screenshot with the Default case added to the For Each action.](..\media\default-case-added.png)

Inside each case, we will increase the respective counter variable; finally, we will add a message box to be displayed:

![Screenshot with Increase variable counters added to each case.](..\media\increasing-counters-based-on-switch-value.png)
