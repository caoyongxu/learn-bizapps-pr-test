Apart from handling web forms and components, Power Automate for desktop enables you to extract data and details from web pages.

To extract information about a web page, use the **Get details of web page** action.  Through this action, you can retrieve descriptive details about web pages, such as its title, metadata keywords, and description. In the action's properties, you have to specify the browser instance and the desired information to retrieve.

To extract details about a specific element rather than the entire web page, you can use the **Get details of element on web page** action. This action requires a browser instance and a UI element describing the element.

If you want to take a screenshot from a web page, you can use the **Take screenshot of web page** action. Deploying this action, you can take a screenshot of the entire web page or a specific element. The action allows you to store the taken screenshot to the clipboard or a file.

## Advanced data extraction

It's common in business procedures to extract web data displayed in the form of tables and lists. Power Automate for desktop enables you to automate these procedures through the **Extract data from web page** action.

Like the other web actions, the **Extract data from web page** action requires a browser instance containing the page from which you'll extract data.

You can save the extracted data into a variable or a newly generated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Depending on the selection, the extracted data can be in any of the following forms:

- **Single value** - The value is stored as a text. The action uses this data form to extract a single value, like a product's name.

- **Handpicked (multiple) values** - The values are stored in a list. The action uses this data form to extract multiple values, like the name and price of a product.

- **Lists** - The action uses this data form to extract a single value from multiple registries, like all available product names.

- **Tables** - The action uses this data form to extract multiple values from multiple registries, like all available product names and prices.

To specify which data to extract, you have to launch a browser window while the **Extract data from web page** is open and wait for the **Live web helper** dialog to appear.

While the platform displays the **Live web helper** dialog, right-click on the desired element, select **Extract element value**, and choose the property you want to extract.

If you repeat the selection for another corresponding value, the action will extract a list containing each related element's respective value.

If you select an additional value, Power Automate for desktop will return a data table containing each element's corresponding data in the list.

To extract data spread throughout multiple pages, right-click on the website's pager button and select **Set element as pager**.

If you want to modify the CSS selectors manually, select the **Advanced settings** option. Manually selector editing allows you to create complex selectors when the automatic selection doesn't satisfy your needs.

To discard a selection you have made, select the **Reset** button on the **Live web helper** dialog.

Lastly, you can select the **Refresh** button to highlight which data to extract based on the current selection. You can take advantage of this feature when you want to repeat a similar extraction for multiple pages.
