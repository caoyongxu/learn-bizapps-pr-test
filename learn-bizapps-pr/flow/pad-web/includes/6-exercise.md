In this exercise, you'll create a flow that extracts gainer stocks from the MSN website and stores them in a new Excel worksheet.

> [!NOTE]
> The exercise is developed based on the USA version of the MSN Money page, but it'll work with all the regional versions with the same structure. If the structure of the page gets updated, you have to modify the flow accordingly. 

1. Launch the Power Automate for desktop console and create a new flow named **Gainer stocks extraction**.

1. Deploy a browser launching action and set its initial URL to the [MSN Money main page](https://www.msn.com/money). For this example, we used the **Launch new Microsoft Edge** action; however, all browser launching actions can be used.

1. Add a **Click link on web page** action and set it to select the **Markets** link on the MSN Money main page.

1. Add a second **Click link on web page** action and set it to select the **GAINERS** link on the **MSN Markets** page.

1. Use the **Extract data from web page** action to extract the names and prices of the gainer stocks.

    1. Set the previously defined browser instance as input and select to save the extracted data in a new Excel spreadsheet.

    1. While the action's properties dialog is open, launch your browser and navigate to the gainer stocks page that you used in the previous steps. Right-click on the name of the first stock and select to extract its text attribute.

    1. Repeat the same procedure for the name of the second stock. If the selection is correct, a list with all gainer stocks must be displayed in the **Live web helper**.

1. Add a **Close Excel** action to save and close the Excel worksheet. Because the file is new, and you will be saving it for the first time, select **Save document as** in the **Before closing Excel** drop-down list.
