In the Introduction to Power Automate security and governance module
of this learning path, we introduced tenant and environment scopes as 
it relates to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. The Admin Analytics 
experience that we will explore in this module, follows a similar scope
model, as does the PowerShell Cmdlets.

Managing environment-scoped assets requires the person administrating
these assets to possess environment admin permissions.

When it comes to managing tenant-scoped assets, the person who is 
administrating these assets must possess tenant admin permissions.
