In this module, we discussed strategies used to establish governance 
and change management processes. We also discussed that the governance 
tools that Microsoft provides can be used for change management purposes. 
When makers use Power Platform tools to improve their productivity, 
administrators should try to encourage those users to help scale the organization.

The Admin Analytics feature, found in the Power Platform Admin Center, is a 
valuable tool for administrators to get insights into their users. This feature 
doesn’t require any intervention by an administrator. It's refreshed automatically 
and keeps data for 28 days.

For situations where administrators want more control, we highlighted many 
PowerShell Cmdlets that you can use to provide administrators with more 
visibility into their user’s actions. 

One benefit of using these cmdlets is that the data can be exported as CSV files. 
This means they can be loaded into an organization’s business intelligence 
tools. In addition to the tools that were discussed, in the next module of this
learning path, we'll learn about how we can search Office 365 Security and Compliance 
logs using a flow template, for Power Automate events. Using this flow, we can detect 
when there are new events, such as newly created flows.
