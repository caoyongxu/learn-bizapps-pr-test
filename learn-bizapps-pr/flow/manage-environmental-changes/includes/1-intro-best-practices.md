Previous modules of this learning path discussed the role of
environments, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, and some of the tools
that you can use to manage these features. This module explains  
how administrators can prepare for making governance changes through 
proactive change management.

Change management is important because it reduces the friction that might occur
when changes are made to Power Platform environments that app makers are
not prepared for. Inevitably, if app makers are not prepared for these changes,
people's expectations won't be met. 

For example, a maker that has built a flow that provides business critical 
automation won't be pleased if someone changes a DLP policy that ultimately 
breaks or disables their flow. Understanding what connectors are being 
used and who has included them in their flows gives an administrator more
confidence about any change that they are about to make.

Another consideration is that change management is not about limiting
what people can do. With change management, you have the ability 
to identify when people are doing exceptional work with Power Platform. 
If you can identify these champions, then it might be a good idea to determine  
how they can be further empowered to help the organization achieve greater
business results.

The following units discuss different tools and techniques that 
you can use to gain insights that will help an administrator manage change 
in their environments.
