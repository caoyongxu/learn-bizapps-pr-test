This exercise demonstrates some actions that are used to organize and manage files and folders.

In this exercise, you will:

- Get the location of the desktop folder for the current user.
- Retrieve the contents of a folder on the desktop.
- Create a new folder on the desktop.
- Copy the contents of the first folder to the new folder.
- Write to a text file.
- Rename the text file to contain the current date and time in its file name.

### Steps

Follow these steps to organize and manage files and folders:

1. Create a folder on your desktop and name it **Important**.

1. Open the new folder, right-click in the folder, go to **New**, and then create a new **Text Document**.

1. Repeat the previous step for other available document or file types. Though no restrictions are placed on the amount, three files should be enough for this exercise.

1. Create a new process and add the **Get special folder** action to the workspace.

1. Set the **Special folder name:** field to **Desktop** and then store it in a variable.

1. To create the log file, add the **Write text to file** action and then set the **File path** field to **%NewFolder%\Backup Log.txt**.

1. In the **Text to write** field, add a message that will show that the process has run successfully.

1. Add the **Rename file(s)** action and then set the **File(s) to rename** field to **%NewFolder%\Backup Log.txt**.

1. In the **Rename scheme** drop-down menu, select the **Add datetime** option.

    The completed process should resemble the following screenshot.

1. Run the process.

After the run process has completed, you will have a new folder called **Backup Files** on your desktop. The folder will contain all contents of the folder named **Important** and an additional text file called **Backup Log**, which will have the last date and time that the process has run appended to its file name.
