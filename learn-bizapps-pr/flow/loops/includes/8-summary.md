There are three kinds of loops in WinAutomation:
* Simple loops, used to perform a predetermined number of repetitions, and in cases where a loop index should be used
* Loop Condition, used when the number of repetitions required is not known, but a condition should be satisfied before proceeding
* For Each loop, used to iterate through the items of a list or table

In addition to the above three Actions, the Exit Loop Action can be used to exit a loop before its end criteria are met; these Actions should be placed within a Conditional block in the loop.

The block of Actions that will be repeated during a loop is designated by the respective loop Action in the beginning, and the **End Loop** Action at the end.
