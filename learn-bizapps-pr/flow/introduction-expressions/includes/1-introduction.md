When you build a flow in Power Automate, it is easy to get started by adding a trigger and actions and then passing data between them with dynamic content. But, sometimes you need to do more. You want the ability to do a calculation or to transform data for your solution. To do these things, you can look to expressions.

In Power Automate, expressions are a set of simple functions that enable you to return data. Put simpler, you use expressions to write a formula to get your data the way you want it. Expressions allow you to do things like convert a date to UTC, divide two numbers, create that perfect string by combining fields, and much more all by using various functions.

Flows in Power Automate run on top of Azure Logic Apps. The most important reason for you to understand that is that they both use all of the same functions. When you are searching the internet for solutions or reading documentation about flow functions, it is common to end up looking at Logic Apps documentation. For example, the [Reference Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference/?azure-portal=true) of functions for Power Automate is hosted on the Logic Apps side of the documentation.

Through the remainder of this module, you will learn about the different types of functions and the syntax so you can start to use expressions in your flows.
