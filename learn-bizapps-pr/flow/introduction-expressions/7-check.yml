  - content: How would you write a formula to add 3 plus 5 and then divide by 2?
    choices: 
    - content: div(add(3,5),2)
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Flow requires the use of an expression phrase like "div" and "add" before being provided numbers to make calculations. Start from the inside (the calculation you want to make first---in this case adding 3 and 5) and then work your way out in the formula as you add additional calculations (in this case, dividing the sum of 3 and 5 by 2).
    - content: (3+5)/2
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Flow requires the use of an expression phrase like "div" and "add" before being provided numbers to make calculations. Start from the inside (the calculation you want to make first---in this case adding 3 and 5) and then work your way out in the formula as you add additional calculations (in this case, dividing the sum of 3 and 5 by 2).
