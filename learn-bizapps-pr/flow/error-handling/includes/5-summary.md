Regardless of how sound the logic is in a workflow, it can fail because of changes in the data source or a use case that wasn't part of the original design. In such scenarios, you need to have a process to handle these errors.

Power Automate includes several features that are available out-of-the-box to help you react quickly to failures that occur in your flows. The analytics that are provided at the per-flow or per-environment level helps you to be proactive. In addition to the error handling, which was covered in this module, detailed reports exist in the Microsoft Power Platform admin center in the Power Automate Runs, Usage, Created, Shared, and Connectors features. These analytics can help you identify the growth of your workflows and make future plans for creating environments and managing their capacity.
