No matter how sound you make the logic in a workflow it can fail because of changes in the data source or a use case that wasn't part of the original design. In such scenarios, you need to have a process to handle these errors.

Power Automate comes with several features that are available out-of-box to help you react quickly to failures that occur in our flows. The analytics provided at the per-flow or per environment level help you be proactive. In addition to the error handling, which was covered in this learning document, detailed reports exist in the Power Platform Admin Center's Power Automate Runs, Usage, Created, Shared, and Connectors. These analytics can help you identify the growth of your workflows and make future plans for creating environments and managing their capacity.
