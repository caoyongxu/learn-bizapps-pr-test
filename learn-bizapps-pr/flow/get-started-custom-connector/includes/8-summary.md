Thisâ€¯module explored how to build custom connectors that can be used with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Azure Logic Apps. You reviewed the key elements that must be configured to make a custom connector usable. Additionally, you built your first custom connector with the sample Contoso Invoicing API, and you used that custom connector in a Power Automate flow, similar to how you would use a built-in connector.
