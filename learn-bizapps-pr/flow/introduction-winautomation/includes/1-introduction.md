WinAutomation enables you to put processes and workflows on autopilot and let your users augment their work to achieve personal and business success. 

WinAutomation can assist in automating repetitive and straightforward tasks, like a backup procedure, mass file renames, daily FTP upload, web data extraction, data entry to a third-party application, or sending emails.
