The heart of WinAutomation is the *process* a term used to describe any action, or series of actions in a task that is automated. For WinAutomation to run a process on behalf of the user, it must be developed first. To begin, you select the **New Process** button in the WinAutomation console, and then use the process designer to build tasks, and view the complete steps in a process.

In the process designer, users can develop an automation, test, debug and troubleshoot it before it is ready to be officially run as a completed ready-to-run WinAutomation process.
