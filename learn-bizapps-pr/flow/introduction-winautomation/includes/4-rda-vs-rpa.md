Robotic Desktop Automation and Robotic Process Automation are similar concepts. WinAutomation supports Robotic Process Auomation.

In Robotic Desktop Automation (RDA), there is an agent installed on a machine that acts as a *robot*. This robot can assist a user with their tasks. It can interact with the user and ask for inputs or advice on how to proceed with running a process. In RDA, a user is also able to start processes that run on the workstation.  

In RDA, a robot can function in *attended mode*, meaning that it can work alongside and with the user, or in *unattended mode* meaning that it can run processes in the user’s absence but still on the user’s behalf.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA), is distributed automation software that works as a user, and creates a virtual workforce of employees. RPA also supports attended and unattended mode.

WinAutomation is a serverless, self-contained desktop automation platform, able to automate any task on a Windows computer. WinAutomation is able to function in both attended and unattended mode. 

WinAutomation is suitable for use by individuals, small or large teams, departments, and enterprises.
