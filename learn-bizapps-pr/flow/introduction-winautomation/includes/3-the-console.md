After development and debugging of a process is complete, the process is visible and ready to run in the WinAutomation console. Users are able to decide how to invoke a process, manually or automatically.

The most straightforward way to run a process is to do so manually. Select the process and click Start in the console. However, WinAutomation also offers the ability to trigger a process on the occurrence of a specific event, like the creation of a file in a folder. 

Additionally, a process can run based on a schedule that the user has set. A schedule is a set of preconfigured times at which the process will run.

When a process runs, any events that need to be reported are shown under the Logs tab in the WinAutomation console. Some of these events may be the start of the process, or the failure of its completion due to an unexpected error.

The WinAutomation console also contains the Options tab, where general WinAutomation settings such as licensing, error handling configuration, backup, maintenance and other settings.
