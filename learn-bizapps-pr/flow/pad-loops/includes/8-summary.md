There are three kinds of loops in Power Automate for desktop:

* Simple loops, used to perform a predetermined number of repetitions, and in cases where a loop index should be used
* Loop condition, used when the number of repetitions required is not known, but a condition should be satisfied before proceeding
* For Each loop, used to iterate through the items of a list or table

In addition to the above three actions, the Exit loop action can be used to exit a loop before its end criteria are met; these actions should be placed within a conditional block in the loop.

The block of actions that will be repeated during a loop is designated by the respective loop action in the beginning, and the End loop action at the end.
