There are three types of Power Automate buttons:

1.  App-based virtual button with a flow with no user input

1.  App-based virtual button with a flow with user input or trigger tokens

1.  Using a physical button

### App-based virtual button with a flow with no user input

Sending an email to your manager by a single click of the Power Automate
virtual button notifying him/her that you will be late for work is an
example of an app-based button with no user input. This virtual button
is available on the Power Automate app for your smart devices. In order
for this flow to not require user input, you'll need to have necessary
data connections, such as Office 365 users, to find your manager's
contact information and also have the email action pre-populated with
the Subject and the Body.

### App-based button with a flow with user input or trigger tokens

Power Automate with user input or trigger tokens is a quick and easy way
to send out notifications. Consider the scenario where you have a
virtual button created which upon a single click provides you the
opportunity to notify and alert the maintenance department regarding
damage. The flow has a drop-down data type to select the location, such
as building or department, and text data type to write a note. Upon
submission, a notification is sent to the key people.

### Using a physical button

There are several third-party companies such as [Flic](https://flic.io/?azure-portal=true)
and [Bttn](https://bt.tn/?azure-portal=true) that provide physical buttons, which integrate
with smart phones and can trigger your flows. The Power Automate mobile
app is required in the smart phones. These flows do not require any user
input.
