Power Automate buttons are an easy and effective way to take repetitive
tasks that we all wish we could run with just a tap of a button. Button
flows allow you to accomplish these and many other tasks simply by
tapping a button on your mobile device. 

There are three types of Power Automate buttons:

1.  App-based virtual button with a flow with no user input

1.  App-based virtual button with a flow with user input or trigger tokens

1.  Using a physical button

In addition, you can create the entire button flow directly from 
a mobile device and you have options available to troubleshoot the 
flow directly from a mobile device.
