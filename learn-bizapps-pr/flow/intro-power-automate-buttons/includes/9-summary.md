Power Automate buttons are a simple and effective way to take repetitive
tasks that everyone would like to run with just a tap of a button. Button
flows allow you to accomplish these and many other tasks by simply
tapping a button on your mobile device.

The three types of Power Automate buttons are:

- An app-based virtual button with a flow with no user input

- An app-based virtual button with a flow with user input or trigger tokens

- A physical button

In addition, you can create the entire button flow directly from
a mobile device, and you have options that are available to help you troubleshoot the
flow directly from a mobile device.
