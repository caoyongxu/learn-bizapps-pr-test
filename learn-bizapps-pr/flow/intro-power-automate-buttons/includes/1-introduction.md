Microsoft Power Automate buttons are the app-based virtual buttons that
provide you the flexibility to automate repetitive tasks with just a tap
of a button from anyplace, at any time via your mobile device. Executing
buttons saves you time and, since the tasks they perform are automated,
there will be less errors than if you manually did them.
