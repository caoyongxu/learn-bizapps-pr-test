Microsoft Power Automate buttons are the app-based virtual buttons that provide you with the flexibility to automate repetitive tasks with just a tap of a button, from any place and at any time, through your mobile device.

Implementing Power Automate buttons saves you time and, because the tasks that they perform are automated, it results in fewer errors than if you did the tasks manually.
