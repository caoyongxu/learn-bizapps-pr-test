Microsoft Power Automate buttons are the app-based virtual buttons that
provide you the flexibility to automate repetitive tasks with just a tap
of a button from any place, at any time via your mobile device. 

Executing buttons saves you time and, since the tasks they perform are 
automated, there will be fewer errors than if you manually did them.
