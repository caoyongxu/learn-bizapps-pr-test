Microsoft Power Automate buttons are the app-based virtual buttons that
provide you with the flexibility to automate repetitive tasks with just a tap
of a button, from any place and at any time, through your mobile device.

Implementing Power Automate buttons saves you time and, because the tasks
that they perform are automated, it results in fewer errors than if you
manually performed the tasks.

Power Automate buttons are the way flows can be executed on demand and
represent one of two ways that flows can be constructed. Most people starting
with Power Automate work with event driven flows for which several templates
already exist which makes the adoption process easier.

The process to share your existing buttons and their respective flows with other
people in your organization is easy. This out of the box efficiency to share your
flows is one of the biggest features Power Automate has to offer because now users
donâ€™t have to worry about having to learn to make or manage their own flows.

This module will introduce you to the capabilities of a Power Automate button.
It provides background and basic learnings you'll use as more detailed information
about buttons is provided in the remaining modules of this learning path.
