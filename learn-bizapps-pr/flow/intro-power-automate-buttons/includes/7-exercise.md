You have a Power Automate button that you have shared with one 
person, and now you'd like to share it with your entire team, which
already has an Office 365 private group. You've been asked to use that
private group to share the app with your entire team.

The high-level steps are as follows:

1.  Confirm the name of the Office 365 Private Group.

1.  Remove the existing user.

1.  Add the new private group and confirm that people are using their own connections.

### Confirm the name of the Office 365 private group

The private group name is Power Platform and its email address is
```powerplatform@xyz.onmicrosoft.com```. You can find this group name in
your Office 365 Outlook.

### Remove the existing user(s)

1.  Go to the Microsoft Power Automate app.

1.  Select the **Power Automate** option, which is available in the bottom
    horizontal navigation pane.

1.  Select your **Late to work** flow and then select **Users and
    connections**. Below **Shared with**, you will see the existing
    user(s). Select their name(s) and then select **Remove user**. Repeat this step 
    for any other users that you have listed there.

### Add the new private group and confirm that people are using their own connections

1.  In **Users and connections**, select **Invite others**.

1.  In **Search people or groups**, enter **Power Platform**. You
    should see the name appear. Select the plus icon (**+**), and the group will be added.
    Select **Send** on the upper right.

1.  A screen will appear that has a green check mark and
    states, **Button was shared successfully**.  
    Select the **Manage connections** option.

1.  In **Manage connections**, you should see both **Office 365 Outlook** and
    **Office 365 Users**. 
    Select each **Edit** option that is located next to each connection, and then confirm that the 
    **Provided by user** option has been selected. 
    If the option is selected, then select **Cancel**; if it is not, select the 
    **Provided by user** option.

You have now successfully shared the button with an Office 365 private group.
