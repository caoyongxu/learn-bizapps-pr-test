Here is a good exercise to get used to the permissions of the Power
Automate button.

Consider a Power Automate button that you have shared with a single
person, and now you'd like to share it with your entire team, which
already has an Office 365 Private Group. You've been asked to use that
Private Group to share that app with your entire team.

Here are the high-level steps.

1.  Confirm the name of the **Office 365 Private Group**.

1.  Remove the existing user.

1.  Add the new Private Group and confirm users are using their own
    connection.

### Confirm the name of the Office 365 private group

The private group name is Power Platform and its email address is
```powerplatform@xyz.onmicrosoft.com```. You can find this group name in
your Office 365 Outlook.

### Remove the existing user

1.  Go to the Microsoft Power Automate app.

1.  Click on the Power Automates option available in the bottom
    horizontal navigation.

1.  Click on your **Late at work** flow and then click on **Users and
    connections**. Below the **Shared with** you will be the existing
    user(s). Click on their name(s) and then click on Remove user. Do
    the same for any other user you have listed there.

### Add the new private group and confirm users are using their own connection

1.  While in the User and connections click on Invite others.

1.  In the Search peoples or groups type in **Power Platform**. You
    should see the name appear. Click on **+**. The group will be added.
    Then click on **Send,** which is available on the top right.

1.  Next, you'll be navigated to a screen which has a green color check
    and text stating **Button was shared successfully**. Below you
    should see **Manage connections**. Click on it.

1.  In the connections, you should see both **Office 365 Outlook** and
    **Office 365 Users**. You should see **Edit** next to each
    connection. Click on each **Edit** and confirm you see **Provided by
    user** option is checked i.e. it has been selected. If it is, then
    click on **Cancel**. If it is not, then select the **Provided by
    user** option.

You have successfully shared the button with an Office 365 Private
group!
