In the Microsoft Power Automate mobile app, you can share a button
with other users or Office 365 Groups within your tenant. When you
share a button, the person or group with whom you share can run your
button. You can also share a link to buttons that another person shared
with you. You can stop sharing your buttons at any time.

There are different ways to share the button that you created in the previous unit 
include:

1.  In the Microsoft Power Automate app, select the **Buttons** icon
    in the bottom menu. You should see the **Late to work** button that
    was created previously. On the bottom right of the button, you should see
    an ellipsis (**...**) and a pop-up
    with two options: **Invite Others** or **Share Button link**.

    The **Invite others** option allows you to search people or groups who are
    part of your company tenant. You can search by using their first or
    last name, select the plus sign (**+**) next to their name, and then 
    select **Send**. You will then be redirected to a screen that
    says, **Button was shared successfully**. 
    
    You will also see a **Manage connections** option. Selecting this option 
    will show you the connections that are used for that flow. In this example, 
    you'll see **Office 365 Outlook** and **Office 365 Users**. Each connection 
    has an **Edit** option next to it. Selecting **Edit** will let you select
    which connection that the user should use. The connection options are
    ones that have been created by the maker of the button or ones that have 
    been created by the user.

3.  The **Share Button link** provides you with the options to share by text
    message, email, or other methods that the smart phone device type and
    service provider allow. For example, in **iPhone iOS**, you can 
    use **AirDrop**. 
    
    After having received the link, the user will need to
    use their credentials to sign in and then start the button from the
    browser. After the user has signed in with their credentials, the data 
    connections are first verified and then you can select the **Continue** 
    button.

The following example shows what the two sharing options look like.
