Business process flows are available in two different varieties:
embedded within a model-driven app and as a stand-alone solution called
an immersive business process flow. You should examine the differences
between each before learning how to create an immersive business process
flow.

Embedded business process flows are visual representations of a series
of work steps within an end-to-end process. They always appear along the
top of a model-driven app in their own control, as shown in the following image.

An immersive business process flow can exist on its own, and it is built entirely
within the Power Automate editor. They will always exist within the default
solution in an instance of Common Data Service, and are only accessible
within Power Automate or the data tab that is associated with an entity in
Common Data Service. Immersive business process flows offer many of the
same advantages of an embedded business process flow, but with the added
advantage of simplified creation and streamlined management.

You will learn how to build an immersive business process flow in the
next units of this module. The following screenshot shows a simple
two-step immersive business process flow.

By taking a closer look, you'll see that immersive and embedded business
process flows look similar. The map of the business process flow
is shown along the top of the screen and a main form is shown beneath it.

The name of the business process flow is shown on the left side of the 
control, while each step (called a Stage) is shown as a red circle. A user
selects the red circle of the current Stage and fills out information in
a drop-down screen that includes various fields (called data steps).

The key difference between immersive and embedded business process flows
is that an embedded business process flow is a component within the larger
model-driven app, while the immersive business process flow is a
stand-alone solution. Embedded and immersive business process flows
help users complete a process within the context of a larger solution. 

A user always views and completes an embedded business process flow within
a model-driven app. An immersive business process flow is a stand-alone
app, and it is built solely for the purpose of completing the business
process. The immersive business process flow exists as the entire solution
rather than a component of a larger model-driven app.

Many of the concepts and techniques
that are discussed and demonstrated within this learning path apply to both
embedded and immersive business process flows. Immersive and embedded
flows are similar. The main difference between them is how they are
launched and the context that they are viewed in.

The remainder of this module is focused on exploring and building an 
immersive business process flow.
