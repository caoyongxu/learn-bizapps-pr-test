In this module, we started getting our hands on the tools and building
our first immersive Business Process Flow. We learned the following:

-   What is an immersive Business Process Flow?

-   What is the difference between an embedded and immersive Business Process Flow?

-   How to create a new immersive Business Process Flow in Power Automate

-   How to add fields to an entity using the Business Process Flow designer

-   How to build and save a simple two step business immersive Business Process Flow using Stages and Data Steps

-   How to run an immersive Business Process Flow

-   How to view the data you created in the new immersive Business Process Flow

Although immersive business process flows are the main focus of this module, Business Process Flows can also be created and embedded within a Model Driven Application. If you want to learn more about embedded Business Process Flows, follow the links below for a series videos demonstrate building an embedded Business Process Flow within a
model driven app. The videos are very informative and led by Microsoft Power Automate Product Managers.
