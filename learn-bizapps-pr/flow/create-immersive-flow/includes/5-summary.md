In this module, we started getting our hands on the tools and building
our first immersive business process flow. We learned the following:

-   What an immersive business process flow is.

-   The differences between an embedded and immersive business process flow.

-   How to create a new immersive business process flow in Power Automate.

-   How to add fields to an entity using the business process flow designer.

-   How to build and save a two-step business immersive business process flow using stages and data steps.

-   How to run an immersive business process flow.

-   How to view the data you created in the new immersive business process flow.

Although immersive business process flows are the main focus of this module, 
business process flows can also be created and embedded within a model-driven 
application. If you want to learn more about embedded business process flows, 
follow the links below for a series of videos that demonstrate the building 
of an embedded business process flow within a model-driven app. The videos are 
informative and led by Microsoft Power Automate Product Managers.
