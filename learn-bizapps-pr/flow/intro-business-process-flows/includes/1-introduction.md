A business process flow is a series of ordered work steps that a user
completes within a business process. In Microsoft Power Automate, a
business process flow is composed of a series of discrete stages that
leads a user along a path toward process completion. Each stage contains
one or more fields (called data steps) that you should complete before
proceeding to the next stage in the business process flow.

A business process flow visually guides a user through stages within a
process and shows progress toward process completion. A user can also
see which stages that they have completed and which stages that they still need 
to complete within an instance of a process. 

Business process flows can be configured to require users to enter information into certain 
fields (data steps) before completing the stage and, if needed, you can 
also allow users to jump stages. All data that is collected while you are completing 
a business process flow is stored in one or more entities in Microsoft Dataverse.

The following illustration shows a simple business process flow with two
stages for adding questions to a survey. The business process
flow is shown as a component of a model-driven solution in Power Apps.

Business process flows are created and managed by using Power Automate, and they 
are available for out-of-the-box entities and for your own custom entities. 
Microsoft has many prebuilt business process flows, or you can create your own.
Additionally, an entity can have none, one, or many business process
flows associated with it. Business process flows are customizable
to fit many organizational needs.

> [!TIP]
> Business process flows are meant to guide users through steps that are required to 
complete a business process. You must have a valid Power Apps Dynamics 365 
license or a valid Power Apps license to create or use a business process flow.
