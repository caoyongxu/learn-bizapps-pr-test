It is not always easy to know when to use a Business Process Flow or
regular Power Automate flow to automate a processes or task. The
following guidelines will help you decide if you should use a Business
Process Flow or a standard Power Automate Flow.

Use a business process flow if:

-   You want to create automated Business Processes with Dynamics Solutions.

-   You want an easy to use visual guide to help users complete a process.

-   You want to use out-of-the-box Business Process Flows.

-   You have a Dynamics 365 License and want to create automated business processes with Common Data Service.

Use a Power Automate flow if:

-   You want to schedule a workflow to start based upon a predefined time interval or after "X" minutes, hours, or days of some action or event.

-   You want to trigger a flow based upon data outside of Common Data Service (SharePoint for example).

-   You do not want to store data captured in the flow in Common Data Service.

-   You want to push notifications outside of Outlook (say SMS or Gmail for example).

-   You want to use and create workflows with only an Office 365 license.
