Knowing when to use a business process flow or a 
regular Power Automate flow to automate a processes or task can be difficult. The
following guidelines can help you decide if you should use a business
process flow or a standard Power Automate flow.

Use a business process flow if you:

-   Want to create automated business processes with Dynamics 365 Solutions.

-   Want a simple visual guide to help users complete a process.

-   Want to use out-of-the-box business process flows.

-   Have a Dynamics 365 license and want to create automated business processes with Common Data Service.

Use a Power Automate flow if you:

-   Want to schedule a workflow to start based on a predefined time interval or after *X* minutes, hours, or days of some action or event.

-   Want to trigger a flow based on data outside of Common Data Service (SharePoint, for example).

-   Do not want to store data that is captured in the flow in Common Data Service.

-   Want to push notifications outside of Outlook (SMS or Gmail, for example).

-   Want to use and create workflows with only an Office 365 license.
