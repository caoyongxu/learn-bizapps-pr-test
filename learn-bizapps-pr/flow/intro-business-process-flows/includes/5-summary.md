Business process flows are a powerful way to visually standardize
and guide users through a process. They ensure consistent implementation
and data collection, can improve the quality of outcomes, and
decrease the cycle times to complete a process.

You can create business process flows as a custom solution, or you can 
choose to use or customize out-of-the box business process
flows that are shipped with Microsoft Dataverse and Dynamics solutions.

Additionally, you can create business process flows as a stand-alone solution
(called an immersive business process flow), or you can include them as a panel within a model-driven app.

An important parameter to remember is that business process flows only store data within Dataverse.

You should use a regular Power Automate flow if you want to store data in a data source outside of Dataverse, or if you want
to trigger the flow based on a time or recurring condition or if you only have an Office 365 license available.
