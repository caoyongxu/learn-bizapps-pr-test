In this module, we learned the following:

-   Business Process Flows are a powerful way to visually standardize
    and guide users through a process. They ensure consistent execution
    and data collection, can improve the quality of outcomes, and
    decrease the cycle times to complete a process.

-   Business Process Flows are easy to create as a custom solution or
    users can choose to use or customize out-of-the box Business Process
    Flows that are shipped with Common Data Service and Dynamics
    solutions.

-   Business Process Flows can be created as a stand-alone solution
    (called an immersive Business Process Flow) or they can be included
    as a panel within a Model Driven App.

-   Business Process Flows only store data within Common Data Service.

-   You should use a regular Power Automate Flow if you want to store
    data in a data source outside of Common Data Service or if you want
    to trigger the flow based upon a time or recurring condition or only
    have an Office 365 license available.
