A business process flow is a visual guide that is meant to help users
complete a business process by using a set of predefined stages. Users are 
not limited on how long they run a business process or how long they have 
a stage open. All data that is associated with the
business process flow can only be stored in one or more entities in
Common Data Service, and you cannot associate a business process flow
with another data source behind it. 

Common Data Service has many different out-of-the-box business process 
flows that you can use in its current state or modify to fit your needs.

A Power Automate flow does not have any visual components like a
business process flow. Power Automate flows can be configured to work
with many different data sources and a flow can connect to many
different data sources within the same flow. A flow can be configured to
time out if it is not completed in a certain time and can be triggered to
move between steps based on data or user interaction. Flows support
complex logic and looping and a Power Automate flow can call
another Power Automate flow as needed.

### Business process flows value to organizations 

Business process flows allow organizations to quickly standardize how 
processes are completed and what data is collected at each stage. Business 
process flows support logical branching so they can be used to standardize 
many common business processes within an organization.

Business process flows offer the following benefits:

-   Improved outcomes

-   Consistent stages and work steps across all instances of the process

-   Improved data collection and reporting

-   Decreased time to complete the process

-   Predictable outcomes

Business process flows are simple to set up and administer. Business
process users who are close to business operations and processes can 
create new business process flows or modify out-of-the-box business
process flows by using Power Automate. 

Business process flows can be customized based on security roles, 
allowing access to the appropriate stages and steps based on a 
security role. Finally, the process of each instance of a business 
process flow can be monitored, and the data from the process flow can 
be used in Power BI dashboards and reporting for simplified administration.

### Business process flows and the larger Power Platform

Business process flows are deeply integrated with the Microsoft Power
Platform. They are created, customized, and managed by using Power
Automate. You can manage or create new business process flows by
launching Power Automate and selecting **Business process flows** under
**My Flows** in Power Automate, as shown in the following image.

You can launch the new business process flows as a component of a model-driven Power App or a stand-alone 
application within Power Automate (called an immersive business process flow), as shown in the following image.

As mentioned previously, all data that is associated with a business process
flow is stored in one or more Common Data Service entities (custom or
standard). You could launch an instant Power Automate flow in
conjunction with a business process flow to store data outside of Common
Data Service if needed. Additionally, you can create Power BI
dashboards from the data that was collected within the business process flow.

Business process flows are deeply integrated
within Power Platform and offer powerful ways to
improve how you manage common business processes.
