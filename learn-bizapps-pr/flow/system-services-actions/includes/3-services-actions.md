WinAutomation enables users to handle Windows services through the **Services** Actions. Using these Actions, users can maintain full control of the operating system and limit the running services.

This group contains four Actions:

- Start Service
- Stop Service
- Pause Service
- Resume Service

All the Actions of the group accept the service name as input and don't return any output. The service name can be entered manually or selected through a drop-down list.
