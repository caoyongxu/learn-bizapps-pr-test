The Read and Write actions can use the currently selected cell as a point of reference. Use the **Get selected cell range from Excel worksheet** action for this purpose by providing the indices of the first and last column and row of the selection.

To change the selected cells, use the **Select cells in Excel worksheet** action. Set the **Select** option to **Absolutely specified cell** to select cells by specifying the upper-left and bottom-right corner cells.

Alternatively, set the **Select** option to **Relatively specified cell** to select a number of cells from the currently selected cell.

To activate a particular cell, use the **Activate cell in Excel worksheet** action. In the **Activate** field, you can either choose to specify a cell by its coordinates (**Absolutely specified cell**) or relative to the currently active cell (**Relatively specified cell**).

It is also possible to insert and delete columns and rows by using the appropriate actions; however, you are required to specify a column or row index. In case of insertion, the row or column will be added before the one that is specified.

The **Run Excel macro** action runs a specified macro saved in the workbook. Specify the name of the macro and any parameters separated by semicolons (;).

For example, a workbook used by the sales department at Contoso Inc. contains a macro called OrderStatus. The macro requires two arguments, the order number and the username, and returns a customer's order status. To look up order number 778 for the username Rbotas, the **Macro** field in the properties of the action would have to be formatted as follows:

 **OrderStatus;778;Rbotas**

 To use variables rather than providing values directly, format the input as follows:

 **%MacroName%;%OrderNumber%;%UserName%**
