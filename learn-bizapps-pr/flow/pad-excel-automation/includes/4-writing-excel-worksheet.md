Write data from the flow to Excel by using the **Write to Excel worksheet**. This action can write any static data or variable to a specified cell, or multiple cells in an Excel worksheet. The action supports two writing modes:

- Write on a specified cell.
- Write on the currently active cell.

To activate a particular cell, use the **Activate cell in Excel worksheet** action.

To write an entire table to Excel, set a data table as **Value to write**. The specified or active cell is the upper-left cell of the written table.

The **Write to Excel worksheet** action accepts as input a previously defined Excel instance and doesn't return any outputs.
