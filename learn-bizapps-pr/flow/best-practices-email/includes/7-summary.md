Emails continue to be the primary format for formal communication. In some scenarios, written approvals through email are considered official, and decisions are made based on that approval.

Microsoft Lists and libraries are user-friendly places to save data, and they are often used for integrating with Power Automate, Outlook mail, and Mail connectors to automatically create dynamic emails.

SharePoint Online, Microsoft Outlook, and Mail connectors are considered standard connectors that you are already licensed to use along with your existing Microsoft 365 Business or Enterprise license.
