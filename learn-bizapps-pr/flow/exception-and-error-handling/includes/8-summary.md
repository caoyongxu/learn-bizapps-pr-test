Exception and error handling in WinAutomation is divided into four levels:

- Level 1: Individual actions
- Level 2: Action blocks
- Level 3: Individual processes
- Level 4: All processes

Exception handling is applied within a process, to handle unexpected circumstances and prevent crashes. When the process cannot recover from an exception, an error occurs and the process execution is terminated. Levels 1 and 2 deal with exceptions within a process, while Levels 3 and 4 dictate the steps taken when a process fails.
