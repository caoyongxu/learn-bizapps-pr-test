Congratulations! You've expanded your skills for creating flows that let you do more while working less.

In the previous modules for Power Automate, you learned how to build simple flows. You've now increased your knowledge by learning about complex data sources, flow scheduling, integration, and complex business processes.

## Continue your journey

Microsoft Learn provides several learning paths, based on your role and interests.

Here are some ways to use Power Automate to get more done with less work when you use Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform. Because these technologies work together, it's easy to measure your business, act on the results, and automate your workflows.

- In this [Power Apps](/learn/paths/create-powerapps/?azure-portal=true) learning path, you'll learn how to build apps that use flows to track or update business processes on any device.

- In this [Power BI](/learn/modules/get-started-with-power-bi/?azure-portal=true) learning path, you'll learn how to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.

- In this [Customer Service](/learn/modules/get-started-with-dynamics-365-for-customer-service/index/?azure-portal=true) learning path, you'll learn how to capture, track, and follow up on sales leads. You'll also learn how to connect to your customer relationship management (CRM) platform.

What's even more exciting is that you can do all this without writing a line of code!
