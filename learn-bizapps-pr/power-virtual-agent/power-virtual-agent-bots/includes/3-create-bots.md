Before you start creating bots, it is important to consider what the bot will be used for. For example, you might use the bot to handle account inquiries, or you could use it for self-service support cases such as knowledge base access. Knowing how you plan to use the bot will help you define and plot out conversation paths and determine how many topics the bot will handle. Other functions that you could consider include using the bot to look up basic account details, perform more advanced account operations, or implement some type of action. The more scenarios that you initially consider, the easier it will be to determine the topics that your bot needs for you to facilitate it.

You can create bots by selecting the bot icon in the Power Virtual Agents interface. Bots are created for each environment. By default, all bots will be created in the [default Power Apps environment for your organization or tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-virtual-agents/environments-first-run-experience/?azure-portal=true), unless otherwise specified. You can choose which environment that you want to use by selecting **more options** to see a list of available environments.

In the **Create a new bot** dialog box, enter a name for your bot. Select **Create** to begin the bot-building process, which can take up to 15 minutes for the first bot that you create in an environment. Subsequent bots take less time to create.

## Delete a bot

Bots that are no longer needed can be removed from your environment. This situation might occur when the bot is being replaced with a different bot, or if the bot no longer fits the needs of your organization. Use the bot icon on the top menu bar and then select the bot that you want to delete. Select the **Settings** icon and **General settings**, and then select the **Delete Bot** option.
