With customers demanding more personalized and efficient customer service experiences, organizations are turning to bots. Bots help provide customers with a self-service support solution that can be interacted with through natural language that simulates human conversation. Bots can resolve simple or common issues, allowing agents to focus on more complicated issues that might require more time. Bots can incorporate information from other systems into the conversation to provide a personalized experience to customers, including the ability to schedule meetings, assign cases, or send emails. With Power Virtual Agents, organizations can create powerful bots through a guided, no-code graphical interface. Organizations can use the power of bots to eliminate the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams and to remove the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code.

This module examined how to get started with Power Virtual Agents, create and deploy bots, and deploy them for consumption across multiple channels, including:

-   Introducing bots, explaining where they are being used, and providing an overview of how Power Virtual Agents can be used to create bots.

-   Examining how to work with and create bots in different environments to tailor the bot content that is being used based on factors such as teams, regions, or other factors.

-   Reviewing the process for creating a bot and how to work with the Power Virtual Agents user interface.

-   Explaining what topics are, the different types that are available, and how they are used as part of a bot.

-   Examining the tools that are available to assist you with testing your bot.

-   Reviewing the process for publishing a bot so that it can be made available across multiple channels and describing the analytics that are available when the bot is published.

Your next step would be to gain a deeper understanding of how to design effective conversation paths to provide users with a better overall experience. This additional learning would include gaining a deeper understanding of what conversation nodes are available, examining how entities and variables can be used to capture and store relevant data, and examining the tools that are available for topic management. You can also use Customer Service Insights to analyze the support topics that come through your entire support operation and understand which to consider automating through Power Virtual Agents.
