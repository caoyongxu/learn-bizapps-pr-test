With customers demanding more personalized and efficient customer service experiences, organizations are turning to bots. They help provide customers a self-service support solution that can be interacted with through natural language that simulates a human conversation. Bots can easily resolve the simple or common issues, allowing agents to focus on more complicated issues that may require more time. Bots can incorporate information from other systems into the conversation to provide a personalized experience to customers, including the ability to schedule meetings, assign cases, or send emails. With Power Virtual Agents, organizations can easily create powerful bots through a guided, no-code graphical interface. Organizations can leverage the power of bots, eliminate the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams, and remove the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code.

We examined how to get started with Power Virtual Agents, create and deploy bots, and deploy them for consumption across multiple channels:

-   Exploring what bots are, where they are being used, as well as providing an overview of how Power Virtual Agents can be used to create bots.

-   Examining how to work with and create bots in different environments to tailor what bot content is being used based on factors such as teams, regions, or other factors.

-   Reviewing the process for creating a bot and how to work with the Power Virtual Agents user interface.

-   Explaining what Topics are, they different types available, and how they are used as part of a bot.

-   Examining the tools that are available to assist with testing of your bot.

-   Reviewing the process for publishing a bot so it can be made available across multiple channels and the analytics that are available once the bot is published.

From here, the next step would be to gain a deeper understanding of how to design effective conversation paths to provide users with a better overall experience. This would include gaining a deeper understanding on what conversation nodes are available, examining how entities and variables can be used to capture and store relevant data, and examining the tools that are available to topic management. You can also leverage Customer Service Insights to analyze the support topics coming through your entire support operation and understand which to consider automating through Power Virtual Agents.
