3.  **Canvas** - Contains components that build a webpage.
4.  **Footer** - Displays autosave status and allows you to open-source code editor.
5.  **Properties pane** - Displays properties of webpage and selected components
    and lets you edit them as required.

## Webpages

Most of a portal's content is represented by webpages. A webpage is a document
that is identified by a unique URL in a website. Through parent and child relationships 
to other webpages, webpages form the hierarchy of a website, that is, its site map. 
Webpages can be added and edited by using the Portal Studio, the portal front-side editor, 
or directly in Microsoft Dataverse by using the Portal Management app.

## Page templates

A webpage row does not define how the page looks when it is rendered on the
portal. Instead, it is linked to the **Page template** row that defines the
layout and the behavior. Think of the webpage as the exact URL and the Page
template as the blueprint for displaying the content.

## Content snippets

Content snippets are reusable fragments of editable content that can be placed
within a web template. Using snippets allows for targeted editing of parts of a
page without affecting the overall content.

Content snippets can include plain text, HTML layout, or template processing
instructions, which helps enable dynamic content. In the example below, **Mobile Header** 
is a content snippet that can be updated with your companyâ€™s logo to quickly and easily tailor the portal to your needs.

Snippets can be edited by using Portal Studio and Microsoft Dataverse rows by
using the Portal Management app. Here is where you would replace the image source in the **Value** column 
with your company's logo.

## Entity lists and entity forms

The strength of Power Apps portals is the ability to interact with information
and data that is stored in Microsoft Dataverse. Table lists and table forms are used 
in Power Apps portals to define what data should render on the portal from Microsoft Dataverse,
such as a list of rows from a table or a form to capture and display data for a specific row.

A webpage row can be linked to a **table list** or an **table form**. The linked
list or form will be used by the template to render the page layout with data
from Microsoft Dataverse, such as a list of all *Active Contacts* to form the above 
*Member Directory* list. In the **Properties** pane on the right of the above example, you
see that this table list was created to display the *Active Contacts* view
from the *contacts* table.

Table lists can include functionality like filtering and sorting and can also have
actions associated with them to enable Create/Edit/Read abilities and to trigger
workflows. With this, App Makers can determine what will happen when a user
opens a row from a list, such as taking them to a form displaying the details
of the selected row.

In the above example, the App Maker has dictated that the user will be taken to
the **Table Form** if they want to *create* or view *details* for a specific row
from a list.
