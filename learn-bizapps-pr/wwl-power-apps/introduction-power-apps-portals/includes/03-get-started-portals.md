Businesses that have Dynamics 365 or a custom Microsoft Dataverse solution
already in place can quickly build portals that are more secure and build their
entire website, all without requiring developers.

A Power Apps portal is not automatically provisioned when a new Dataverse 
environment is created. You will need to provision a Power Apps portal
and determine the name, default URL, language, and template.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>   To provision a portal, you must be assigned the System Administrator role of the Microsoft Dataverse environment that is selected for the portal.

## Portal templates

When provisioning a Power Apps portal, the most important choices to consider
are the audience, workload, and choosing a specific portal template that would
best align with the business requirements.

Several portal templates are available that can be provisioned. These templates
will accelerate the configuration of portals based on the intended audience and
workload.

If you are building a custom business application by using Microsoft Dataverse
without Dynamics 365 apps enabled, your only choice is the **Portal from blank** option.

If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales or
Dynamics 365 Service, you have a choice of five additional portal templates:

-   Community portal

-   Customer self-service portal

-   Employee self-service portal

-   Partner portal

-   Customer portal (Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management)

>[!NOTE]
>Specific features and components a specific starter portal can be added to another starter portal, as required.

Make sure that you define the type of audience who will visit the new portal.
The audience will determine which options of portal you will be given.
