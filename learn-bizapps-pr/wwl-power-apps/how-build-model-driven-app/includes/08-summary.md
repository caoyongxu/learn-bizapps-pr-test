Model-driven app design is a component-focused approach to app development. Model-driven app design does not require code, and the apps you make can be simple or very complex. Unlike canvas app development, where the designer has complete control over app layout, with model-driven apps much of the layout is determined for you and largely designated by the components you add to the app.

This module covered the following concepts:

*	What model-driven apps are and their differences from canvas apps
*	The building blocks of model-driven apps
*   How to design and create model-driven apps
*	How to change security and share model-driven apps
