Model-driven app design is an approach that focuses on adding dashboards, forms,
views, and charts to your apps. With little or no code, you can build apps that
are simple or very complex.

In canvas apps, the app maker has total control over the app layout. In
model-driven apps, on the other hand, much of the layout is determined by the
components you add. The emphasis is more on quickly viewing your business data
and making decisions instead of on intricate app design.

In this module, you will:

-   Learn what model-driven apps are and how they differ from canvas apps

-   Learn the building blocks of model-driven apps

-   Learn how to create and design model-driven apps

-   Learn how to change security and share model-driven apps
