## Open and add a view in the app designer

2.	To add a view, select it by using view types such as Public, Advanced Find, Associated, and Lookup. The view is automatically added to the **Views** list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Views are displayed based on the entity that you have selected. For example, when you select Account, views that are related to the Account entity are displayed.

## Add a column to your view in app designer

Views display records in a table that contains rows and columns. Each row is a record, and the fields you display from the record are determined by the columns you add to the view.

1.	In app designer, select the entity view that you want and then on the right pane next to the view that you want select edit (pencil button).

2.	On the **Components** tab, select the **Column Attributes** list for either the **Primary Entity** or **Related Entity**.

    ![Account views](../media/column-attributes.png)

3.	From the list, select the attribute you want and drag it to the column heading. You can also add the attribute by double-clicking it.

4.	Repeat step 3 until you have added all the attributes you want to display in your view.

As you add attributes, you can drag them to any position among existing column headings. You can also move columns around after you add them to your view.

## Publish your app

On the App Designer toolbar, select **Publish**. After you publish the app, it
is ready for you to run or share with others.

Above My Active Accounts, select **Show Chart**.

If the sample data for your accounts does not have an Industry populated, go
into a few accounts and add an Industry. Once you have updated a few accounts
with an industry, the chart will update as well.
