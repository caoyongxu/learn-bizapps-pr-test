Power Virtual Agents empowers teams to easily create powerful chatbots using a
guided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or
developers. Power Virtual Agents addresses many of the major issues with bot
building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the subject matter
experts and the development teams building the bots, and the long latency
between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it. It
removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and
the need to write complex code. Also, it minimizes the IT effort required to
deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

3.  **Enable rich, natural conversations.** Microsoftâ€™s powerful conversational
    AI capabilities enable your end users to have rich multi-turn conversations
    that quickly guide them to the right solution. And, unlike most products on
    the market, there is no need to retrain AI models. Simply provide a few
    short examples of the topic you want the chatbot to handle, build the
    conversation using the graphical editor, and your chatbot is ready to handle
    customer requests. You can even try out your changes in real-time in the
    test pane!

4.  **Enable chatbots to take action.** Chatbots that can chat with your users
    are great, but chatbots that can act on their behalf are even better. With
    Power Virtual Agents, you can easily integrate with services and back-end
    systems out-of-the-box or through hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors
    using Power Automate. This makes it simple to create a chatbot that not only
    responds to the user, but also acts on their behalf.

    keep an eye on how your chatbots are performing using powerful metrics and
    AI-driven dashboards. Easily see which topics are doing well and where the
    chatbot can improve, and quickly make adjustments to improve performance.
