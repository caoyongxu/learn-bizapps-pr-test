When it comes to building a Power Apps Canvas App there are lot of components you can use to build your solutions. There are screens, inputs, galleries, forms and more. Let's review some of the most common elements you will need to get started.

## Power Apps Studio

This is the name of the web interface you use to build your app. With Power Apps there is no client to download or install for building apps. Everything is done from the browser by logging into [https://make.Power Apps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/)

## App format

The first step in creating your app is to choose the format of your app. You have two types - Mobile and Tablet. While both formats can be used interchangeably on a mobile device, a tablet, or on a computer each has different defaults around sizing of the screens and controls. Once you choose the format for an app you cannot change it.

## Galleries

The Gallery control is used to display records from a table of data. After adding a gallery you can modify the template for a record. This allows you to control which fields are shown and how they are formatted. Power Apps will then apply this template automatically to every record in your data.

## Forms

Forms are focused on working with a specific record, often based on a selection from a gallery. This allows you to make an experience where a user browses a gallery to find the record they want and then after selecting the record the form shows all of the details from the chosen record. You can then enable the user to use that save form to edit that chosen record. The same form can also be used to create new records. Forms have different modes that allow form to serve many purposes.

## Inputs

To allow you maximum flexibility in customizing your apps Power Apps has a large selection of various Input controls. Text inputs, buttons, dropdowns, toggles, date pickers, sliders, and more. You can add these controls to galleries, forms, and screens to build a great experience for your app. And all inputs have a multitude of settings for default data, formatting, and actions which allow you to build an app that has the right user experience for your business process.

## Functions

Functions are the glue that binds all of these controls, inputs, and data sources together. You can use one or more functions to create formulas in your apps. These formulas can be for things such as sending data to a data source, formatting information, creating animations, and more. And the best part these formulas are very similar to what you build in Excel. No complicated code here, just powerful functions with straightforward inputs to enhance your app.

Now that you have an overview of some of the rich functionality you can achieve with Power Apps the next section will walk you down the path of building your first app.
