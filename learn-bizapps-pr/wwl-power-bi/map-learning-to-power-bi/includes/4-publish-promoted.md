## Publishing

Power BI service allows you to share your data sets and reports:
- Publishing enables developers to share content with end users.
- You can share an individual report with specific people, or with Office 365 groups.
- Comments can be created around a page, specific visual, or dashboard tile.

> [!TIP]
> This may be the first time that your students hear about Power BI service. Take the time to make sure they understand the different between Power BI desktop that you’ve already covered, and Power BI service that you are now starting to cover.

## Promoted datasets
In this section you’ll deliver the promoted datasets section and explain how to create, manage, and secure reports based on existing truthful and accurate datasets. 

> [!TIP]
> While discussing promoted and secure data sets and scheduled refreshes, be careful not to get too detailed for your audience or your class schedule. The goal of this section is to make it clear that these options exist and are valuable.

Power BI service allows you to promote or certify your data sets and reports to create trusted analytics:
- Create new reports based on existing datasets…especially those that are considered truthful and accurate
- User can “promote” a data set or request it be “certified”
- Power BI Admin applies certified status 

You can also control the refresh process for your datasets and save time, bandwidth, and computer resources:
- Decide when and how often your data refreshes
- Incremental refresh…only refresh what you need!

> [!TIP] 
> The value proposition for controlling refreshes is mainly focused on IT. For the Data Analyst it’s more about making it easier to always have the latest data.
