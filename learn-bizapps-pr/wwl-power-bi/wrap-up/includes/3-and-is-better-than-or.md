In this section you will explain how to use Excel and Power BI together.

> [!TIP]
> Before starting this section think about the types of analysis problems that your students are handling now and would like to handle in the future. By highlighting these dual platform situations, you are outlining possible first steps from Excel to Power BI.

A couple of examples of using first one and then the other:
- Use Excel to work on a small subset of data to gain preliminary insights and then harness Power BI to dive further into the data. 
- Visuals, reports, and datasets in Power BI can be exported to Excel for analysis. 
- Power BI can import Excel data models and files for analysis too
- Connecting Power BI to a form-like data collection tool in Excel is a simple, flexible, and familiar way of getting manual data entry functionality into Power BI. 

> [!TIP]
> Again, as you deliver this comparison of Excel and Power BI, reuse the examples from the last slide, earlier in the class, or from your students experience to ground the recommendations.
