In this section you will start with a quick overview of Pivot tables to remind you students what Pivot tables are and why you use them before shifting to Power Pivot.

## What is a Pivot Table?
- Field List
- Filters, Columns, Rows, Values 


## Why should we use them?
Pivot Tables are one of the most powerful tools available to us as analysts as they allow us to perform calculations over large amount of data and summarize the output visually in easy to understand tables.

## Power Pivot demonstration

Now that you’ve introduced Power Pivot in Excel, it’s time to show your students how it really works.

The demo is recorded and will automatically play in the slide deck so you can focus on explaining the steps as the video plays.

> [!NOTE]
> The slides for demos are marked with a speaker icon in the upper right corner.

In this demo you will:
1.	Utilize multiple tables from the data model
1.	Utilize 3 Measures:
    1.	Number of Unique Customers Quoted
    1.	Avg. Potential MRR per Customer
    1.	MRR % of Grand Total 
1.	Utilize Slicer and Timeline to easily slice the Pivot Table

> [!TIP]
> This demo is nearly identical to the Lab. Remind your students that they will be doing this next to help them focus on the steps that you are demonstrating.

> In this 7-minute video Krissy Dyess shows you how to introduce Power Pivot, and then demonstrate creating a Power Pivot that utilizes multiple tables from the data model, 3 Measures, the Slicer, and the Timeline.


## Calculated Columns
In addition to the Implicit and Explicit Measures, we have what are called Calculated Columns: 

- Calc. Columns evaluate Row by Row
- Measures used in Values… to aggregate
- Calc. Columns used in Rows, Columns, Filters or Slicers

> [!TIP]
> Calculated Columns also use DAX formulas!  So, it can be a little confusing for some of your students.
