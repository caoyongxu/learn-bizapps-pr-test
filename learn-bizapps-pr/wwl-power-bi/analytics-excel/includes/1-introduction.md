2.	Edit the file properties, and “unblock”
3.	Extract the file contents to your file system. The lab documents will refer to this location as <CourseFolder>

### Power BI account
You are responsible for having your own Power BI account.

Check that you have Power BI Desktop installed
•	Power BI Desktop is free to download
•	Most recent monthly release is best!

Launch Power BI Desktop
•	Sign-in to the Power BI Service

### Copy paste snippets
To improve accuracy and reduce typing, many labs involve copying and pasting from snippet files. 
When snippet files are available, do not copy from the lab documents—rich-formatted text blocks often paste incorrectly, and you’re they’re likely to get a strange result in your code.

•	Avoid the temptation to just copy-and-paste
•	Take the time to understand the intention of each snippet
