## Modern tools

This section is a short side trip into XLOOKUP and FILTER() to start your students thinking about finding and sorting data. These tools give you students a quick example of some of the new updates in Excel and prepare them to be successful in the rest of the course. 


### XLOOKUP() 
The key message here is that this is a more robust and easer lookup that replaces:
- VLOOKUP 
- HLOOKUP
- INDEX()
- Match()


### FILTER()
Is a quick and easy tool for retrieving data.
