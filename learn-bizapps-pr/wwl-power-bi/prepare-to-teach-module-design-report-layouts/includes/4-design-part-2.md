## Video: Designing report layouts - Part 3

In this 21-minute video, Peter Myers and Chris Finlan describe how to design report layouts, including setting properties dynamically.

A couple of key points to share with your students when you deliver this section:
- Use a report variable to hold a value for time-dependent calculations
    - They are calculated once, and can be used in expressions throughout a report
    - The value is preserved throughout a session, until the report is processed again

- Use report items to add visual interest to the layout

- Use a subreport to display another paginated report inside the body of a main paginated report
    - Any paginated report can be embedded, providing it is stored in the same workspace as the parent report
    - Typically, the parent reports pass parameters to the subreport
    - Sub-reports can repeat within data regions, especially the List

- Use expressions to assign dynamic values to properties
    
- Use functions from:
    - A variety of .NET namespaces
    - Custom code (code block)

- Use the Code block to embed complex functions, or functions that are used multiple times within a single report.
    - Code must be written in VB.NET
    - Can leverage any available .NET Framework libraries

## Video: Designing report Layouts - Part 4

In this 6-minute video, Peter Myers and Chris Finlan put together all the theory and demonstrate designing a report template.

> [!TIP]
> If you have students who are new to report creation, a discussion on the value of templates is appropriate here.
