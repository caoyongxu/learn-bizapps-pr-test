## Data Modeling and Visualizations

Power BI offers tools all along your data journey, beginning with data transformation and modeling. With the ability to add and manipulate columns, create new measures and tables, and filter or group your data without affecting the underlying data set, Power BI helps you to transform your data to leverage it to the fullest potential.

In addition, Power BI helps you model data from disparate sources. Easily define relationships and connect columns from multiple sources in the relationships tab. These features enable you to model your data in a way that make sense and allows you to pull data from lots of places into one visual.

Visuals allow you to present data in a compelling and insightful way, and help you show the important components of it. Power BI has many compelling visuals and many more that are released frequently. Visualizing data is one of the core parts and basic building blocks of Power BI. Creating visuals is one of the most effective ways to find and share your insights.

You'll discover a wide variety of visualizations in Power BI, which offers features such as simple bar charts, pie charts, maps, and more esoteric offerings like waterfalls, funnels, and gauges. Power BI Desktop also offers extensive page formatting tools, such as shapes and images, that help bring your report to life.

## Security and Administration

Security is at the forefront of data concerns. Administration is at the forefront of business concerns. Thankfully, Power BI's structure and capabilities make both simple to business users and administrators to provide peace of mind.

### Security

Similar to many Microsoft services, Power BI is built on Azure, which is Microsoft's cloud computing infrastructure and platform, ensuring the same level of security. Users log in with their credentials held in Azure Active Directory (AAD) and control the level of sharing for every report, data or dashboard, determining whether recipients can edit or only view items. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that users are responsible for the data they share. If a user connects to data sources using their credentials, then shares a report (or dashboard, or dataset) based on that data, users with whom the dashboard is shared are not authenticated against the original data source and will be granted access to the report. This is beneficial to allow users to share reports and dashboards they have created but does require responsibility on the user's part.

For more in-depth information on Power BI security, be sure to check out the resources of this module in the last unit.

### Administration

Power BI administration is the management of a Power BI tenant, including the configuration of governance policies, usage monitoring, and provisioning of licenses, capacities, and organizational resources.

Power BI is designed for self-service business intelligence, and the administrator is the guardian of data, processes, and policies in the Power BI tenant. A Power BI administrator is a key member of a team that includes BI developers, analysts, and other roles. The administrator can help support an organization to make sure that critical goals are met.

While administration is too broad a topic to cover in detail here, you can find more information on Power BI administration including roles, tasks and tools by accessing the links in the resources unit at the end of this module.
