Power BI Desktop connects to many types of data sources, including local databases, worksheets, and data on cloud services. Sometimes when you gather data, it's not quite as structured, or clean, as you want it to be. To structure data, you can transform it, meaning that you can split and rename columns, change data types, and create relationships between columns.

You can connect Power BI Desktop to many types of data sources, including on-premises databases, Microsoft Excel workbooks, and cloud services. Currently, there are over 110 Power BI-specific connectors to cloud services such as GitHub and Marketo. You can also connect to generic sources through XML, CSV, text, and ODBC. Power BI will even extract tabular data directly from a website URL.

In this module, we will build out a dashboard for Contoso Manufacturing displaying their sales data for various products. To follow along with the next steps, visit [https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download](/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download) and download the financial sample workbook to your local files or One Drive.  If this is your first time using Power BI Desktop, please visit [https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-get-the-desktop](/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-get-the-desktop) for download instructions.
