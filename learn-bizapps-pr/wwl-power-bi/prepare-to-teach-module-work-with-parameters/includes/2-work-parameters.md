## Video 11: Working with Parameters - Part 1	

In this 9-minute video, Peter Myers and Chris Finlan introduce query parameters and report parameters. 

Parameters are typically used to filter report data.  
There are two types, and while their purposes are different, they are often related:
- Use **report parameters** to retrieve values at report execution time. Commonly, report users are prompted to enter report parameter values
    - Use report parameters to retrieve values at report execution time
    - Commonly, report users are prompted to enter report parameter values

- Use **query parameters** to pass values to a dataset query
    - They can be used to pass values to:
        - Query statements like WHERE clause predicates
        - Stored procedure parameters

    - Adding a query parameter to a dataset query automatically creates a report parameter and mapping
        - Query parameters for SQL Server and Analysis Services data sources are prefixed with the @ symbol


> [!TIP]
>  Take a moment and ask your students about the parameters that they find valuable.  Answering this question will start them thinking about applying this concept to their own reports.

## Video 12: Working with Parameters - Part 2	

In this 11-minute video, Peter Myers and Chris Finlan describe different parameter scenarios:  
- Adding an “All” item
- Multi-value parameters
- Cascading parameters
- Parameters built-in collection
- Configuring with designers

> [!TIP]
>  If these scenarios match your students parameter list from above, highlight this strongly so they all know that you are solving their issues.

## Video 13: Working with Parameters - Part 3	

In this 20-minute video, Peter Myers and Chris Finlan enhance the Sales person directory and demonstrate configuring parameters in different scenarios.


The goal of this demo to show your students how to set up a report so their users can filter down the report to just the items that they are interested in. 

> [!Tip]
> Spend a couple moments with your students discussing what type filters their users would look for. This will get them out of a "generic user" mode and help them think about how they would actually apply this demo to their own environment.
