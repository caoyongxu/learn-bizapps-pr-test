In this section you will first explain how to create a Pivot Table and PivotChart to explore Store Return Rates by Date using a Certified Power BI dataset. Remember that certified data sets are endorsed by your Power BI tenant administrator.

You will demonstrate:
1. Insert a new Pivot Table (from a Power BI Dataset) using data from a Certified Power BI dataset.
1. Drag & Drop [Date] on Rows, [Return Rate] into Values.
1. Create a PivotChart to compare two specific stores.


> [!TIP]
> find out what departments your students work in and discuss the demo using the data types that they will be familiar with. This will make the content much more relevant to them.
You will also discuss how to deal with data sensitivity and Microsoft Information Protection/Row Level Security (RLS).
