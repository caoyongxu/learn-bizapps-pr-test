In this module we covered how to teach and demonstrate:

- Creating data sources
- Creating datasets

## Recommended practices
- If your data source is not natively supported, use Power BI Desktop to create a model first
- Use stored procedures, when possible:
    - Better performance
    - Re-use of logic
    - Ease of maintenance
- For Power BI Desktop or Analysis Services sources, use the DAX query designerâ€”unless you need server aggregates or calculated members


## resources
These resources will help you better understand data retrieval for Power BI reporting and Power BI paginated reports.

They will also allow you to provide additional information when you are explaining these topics to your customers.
