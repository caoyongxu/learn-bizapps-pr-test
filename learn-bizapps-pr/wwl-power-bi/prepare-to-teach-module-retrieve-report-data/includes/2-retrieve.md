### Recommended practices:
- If your data source is not natively supported, use Power BI Desktop to create a model first
- Use stored procedures, when possible:
    - Better performance
    - Reuse of logic
    - Ease of maintenance
- For Power BI Desktop or Analysis Services sources, use the DAX query designer, unless you need server aggregates or calculated members
