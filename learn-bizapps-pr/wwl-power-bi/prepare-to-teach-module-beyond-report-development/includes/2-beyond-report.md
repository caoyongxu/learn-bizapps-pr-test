## Video 20: Beyond report development - part 1
In this 14-minute video, Peter Myers and Chris Finlan describe how to publish reports to the Power BI service, and cover consuming, delivering, and embedding paginated reports. Finally, they discuss when it's a good choice to create a paginated report instead of a Power BI report.

- Reports can be saved to a Power BI workspace from Report Builder  
- The reports workload enabled  
- It can also be uploaded in the Power BI service by using “Get Data”  

- Once published, completing additional tasks may be required before the report can be used  
    - Configuring report data sources  
        - Cloud sources  
        - On-premises sources
    - Configuring the report settings  
        - Adding contacts  
        - Enabling or disabling comments  
    - Making the report available to others
