  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "One of your colleagues would like to set up a Flow to write an item to a SharePoint list when they receive an email from their boss. Which of the following would get them started?"
    choices:
    - content: "See if any templates are available for this scenario. If one exists, use that, otherwise create a blank Flow with a \"When an email is received\" trigger."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Don't discount the template store in Power Automate; more often than not, someone has already solved this problem before. However, if they haven't, you can just create a new Flow and use the appropriate Trigger to achieve your goal."
    - content: "Create an \"Instant\" Flow and set the trigger to be \"When an email is received\", then add an action for creating the SharePoint item."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Instant Flows require user input, whether it's from Power Apps, a Flow button, or otherwise. There's no action for \"When an email is received\" when you're building an instant Flow."
    - content: "Create an \"Automated\" Flow with only one action: create an item in SharePoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This won't work because all Flows must have a trigger. A Flow without a trigger is like a pea without its pod - one can't exist without the other."
  - content: "Your department would like to set up an approval system for items that are being written to a SharePoint list. You have been assigned the task of creating the system. Using Flow, what's the best approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Automated Flow from Blank and add a trigger for \"When a new item is created\" in SharePoint, and actions for the approvals."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you could certainly approach this problem in this way, it's easier just to use the built-in SharePoint Approvals Flows because they were designed to solve this problem. If it were a different data source, this could well be the best answer."
    - content: "Generate an Approval Flow from the built-in SharePoint Approvals functionality on your SharePoint list."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Why reinvent the wheel? SharePoint's built-in Approvals Flows are great, and using the information in this module you can set them up quickly and easily."
    - content: "Set up a blank Flow to send approval emails to the department manager when a new item is created in the SharePoint List."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You could do this, but it wouldn't include all of the Approval actions that you need. Just sending an email to the manager isn't going to allow them to approve anything, it will just show them the information."
  - content: "Your organization has started using lots of Approval Flows, and users are complaining that they have too many approvals to keep track of. They donâ€™t know what is approved and what is still pending their approval. What is the easiest way for them to check?"
    choices:
    - content: "Have the users navigate to the Approval Center in Power Automate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In the Approval Center, users will be able to view their outstanding approvals as well as their approval history in a much easier-to-read platform. All of the approvals that require that user's interaction will be available through the Approval Center."
    - content: "Have the users set up Outlook rules to catch approvals so they are more visible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Rules are great to keep your Outlook mailbox clutter-free, but there is a better solution to this problem using Approval Flows in Power Automate."
    - content: "Send the users to the SharePoint list, which holds the records being approved to review which ones are approved and which ones are not."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would be one way to tackle the problem, but it is very cumbersome on the user. Instead, try to think of something within Power Automate that would show them all of the approvals they are associated with in one easy-to-read place."
  - content: "One of your colleagues would like to post information about SharePoint items that have been approved to Twitter. Is this possible? If so, how would he do it?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, it's not possible. SharePoint lists don't connect to Twitter directly, so there's no way to Tweet about approved items."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Flow connects to hundreds of third-party data sources out of the box, with Twitter being included in that list. This module teaches you how to achieve exactly what the user wants."
    - content: "Yes, it's possible. He can create a Flow to monitor his SharePoint list for approved items, then notify him so he can Tweet the details manually."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Flow supports Twitter actions out of the box, so there's no need to do this step manually. This module teaches you how to automate the process."
    - content: "Yes, it's possible. He can create a Flow to monitor his SharePoint list for approved items, then Tweet the details."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This was covered in this module, so you can refer back to earlier in the module to see how he could achieve it."
