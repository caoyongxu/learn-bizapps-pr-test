Of course we have an app -- the Power Automate mobile app! From this app, you
can access these features:

-   Activity Feed

-   Browsing

-   Buttons

-   Managing Flows

First, you'll need to download and install the Power Automate mobile app from
your app store.

After it's installed, start it and sign in.

When you first start the app, you'll see the Activity Feed. The Activity Feed is
the place to see what's happening with your flows. It won't be the full
experience you'd expect from your PC, but it will show you useful details.

For example, you'll see a flow's last activity. You can see whether the flow
succeeded or failed. If it failed, you'll see which step it failed on.

## Create a button flow

Buttons are flows that are started through a manual action. For example, you can
create a button to send a *Working from home today* email to your manager. If
you live far from your workplace, you can then use this button on days when the
traffic is a mess!

-   Select **Buttons** to use some of these flows.

-   Select **Browse** to check out templates for more button flows that you can
    add to your collection.

To show you how you can use buttons, we'll use the **Send myself a reminder in
10 minutes button** template.

1.  Select **Browse**.

2.  Select the **Send myself a reminder in 10 minutes button** flow.

    The flow is saved.
5.  Select **Buttons** to see the new flow.

6.  Select the flow. In 10 minutes, you will get a reminder.
