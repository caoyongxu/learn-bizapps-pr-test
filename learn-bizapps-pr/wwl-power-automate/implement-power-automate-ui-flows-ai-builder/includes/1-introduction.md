Microsoft Power Platform is a powerful low code platform that helps you build intelligent modern apps and experiences around your data and business processes, even as a business user, without being a professional developer or data architect.

Power Automate, a pillar of Power Platform, is used to automate repetitive business processes.  With AI Builder and robotic process automation, businesses can take business process automation to a new level, by infusing intelligence into the automation and broadening the scope of use by integrating with legacy applications.

In this module, you will:

- Create a Power Automate flow to automate routing and approval of an invoice.

- Use AI builder to create a prediction model to automatically parse information from sample invoice documents.

- Implement robotic process automation with UI flows to automate entry of information into a legacy application.

With each unit in this module we will walk you through the process of taking a simple Power Automate flow that routes an invoice to a Teams channel and quickly and easily add AI builder functionality to parse content needed to process the invoice,  automate the approval process, and then use a UI flow to enter information into a legacy business application.

Watch this video to get started, with an understanding of the process flow.
