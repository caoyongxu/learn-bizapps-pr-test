## The building blocks of PowerApps
Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what’s important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

Power BI can be simple and fast – capable of creating quick insights from an Excel spreadsheet or a local database. But Power BI is also robust and enterprise-grade, ready for extensive modeling and real-time analytics, as well as custom development. So it can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

Power BI consists of a Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps available on Windows phones and tablets, as well as for iOS and Android devices.

PowerApps connects to the **cloud services and data sources** you're already using, giving you the ability to **quickly build apps** that suit specific needs - building on skills you already have. You can share apps instantly with your co-workers across the web, tablets, and mobile devices. PowerApps also integrates with **Microsoft Flow**, making it possible to trigger workflows from within apps. PowerApps can be **simple and fast**  -  capable of producing an app in minutes that pulls in data from Excel or a cloud service. But PowerApps is also robust and **enterprise-grade**, ready for complex requirements like tracking assets across a corporation and tying into your backend systems.

## The Parts of PowerApps
PowerApps consists of components to create, share, and administer apps; and components to run those apps. You create apps in  **PowerApps Studio** using the **data connections** that your app requires. You use **web.powerapps.com** to configure and manage data connections and on-premises gateways, and to work with the the Common Data Service for Apps. After you create an app, you often share it to **Microsoft AppSource**, and administer it in the **admin center**.

You run apps in a browser from **Microsoft Dynamics 365** or by using **PowerApps Mobile**, which is available for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

We will follow this flow of creating, sharing, administering, and running apps as we go through the rest of PowerApps Guided Learning.

## How PowerApps matches your role
PowerApps makes it easy for **business analysts** and other subject matter experts to **create apps using the skills you already have**. But this is not the only type of PowerApps user. Some people simply run apps that others create. Other people, who write code for a living (professional developers), take advantage of PowerApps to rapidly build sophisticated apps.

How you use PowerApps may depend on your role in a project or on a team, and your role can change. For example, one of your coworkers creates an app that is tied into your company-wide customer relationship management (CRM) system, and you use this app regularly to track promising sales leads. But you might also write apps yourself and share them within your workgroup because your close colleagues find those apps very useful.
