Enhancing report designs with rich and compelling features is about delivering report requirements while taking the user experience to the next level. Keep in mind that your report consumers might not know how to work with all user experiences. As you publish a report, consider providing instructions or video recordings to show how you intend the consumers to interact with it. Also, consider surveying your report consumers to understand what works and what doesn't and ask for suggestions.
