Highlighting values in reports helps you to quickly communicate important and relevant facts about data. Power BI supports several techniques to highlight values:

- Conditional formatting
- Overlaid analytics
- Anomaly detection
- Specialized visuals

### Conditional formatting

You can use conditional formatting to format table and matrix visuals. With this approach, you can apply rules to highlight specific cells by using:

- Background color
- Font color
- Data bars
- Icons

The following image shows an example of a matrix visual with icons. The icons highlight the **On hand** values.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Image shows a matrix visual titled \"Inventory on hand breakdown\". The On hand column includes various city values. A circular icon indicates highest and lowest values. An empty circle represents the lowest value; a filled circle represents the highest value.](../media/conditional-formatting-icons.png)](../media/conditional-formatting-icons.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> Consider that report consumers might be blind or have low vision. Take care not to highlight by using only color. Instead, consider using icons that can use shape and color to communicate status.

### Overlaid analytics

You can also overlay analytics to highlight values. Certain visuals, like the line chart visual, allow you to add analytic options. Options include trend lines, constant lines, minimum or maximum lines, and many others.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Image shows the Analytics pane. Sections include Trend line, and many other line types.](../media/overlaid-analytics-pane.png)

The following image is an example of a trend line. The upward gradient of the trend line clearly indicates that returns are increasing over time.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Image shows a line chart titled Returns over time. The time series is for returns made during the month of June . An overlaid trend line that is a dashed line indicates that returns are increasing over time.](../media/overlaid-analytics-trend.png)

### Anomaly detection

When a time series (date field) is on the X-axis, two additional analytic options are available. These options use AI to produce a forecast or find anomalies. The anomaly detection feature can help you highlight exceptional values.

The following example shows a line chart visual. Power BI detected an anomaly on a particular date and marked it with a shape. When the report consumer hovers the cursor over the shape, a tooltip appears that describes expected values.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated.](../media/find-anomalies.png)](../media/find-anomalies.png#lightbox)

Select the anomaly shape to open the **Anomalies** pane, which lists a series of visuals that provide further possible explanations.

### Specialized visuals

Some specialized visuals can help to highlight values in your reports; specifically, the **Key influencers** visual and the **Decomposition Tree** visual. These two visuals are covered in Unit 8.
