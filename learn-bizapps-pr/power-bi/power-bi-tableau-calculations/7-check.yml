  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Which table DAX function allows you to create a temporary table?
    choices: 
    - content: ALL
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: The ALL function returns all the rows in a table, and uses that table (or subset of values) in an expression.
    - content: CALCULATE
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The CALCULATE function just evaluates an expression in a modified filter context. You would use a temporary table to define the filter parameter.
    - content: SUM
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The SUM function just adds all the numbers in a column. There's no temporary table associated to the function.
  - content: What is the purpose of DAX?
    choices: 
    - content: It's used to create visualizations in Power BI Desktop
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You don't build visualizations with DAX.
    - content: It's used to prepare data before it can be loaded into the Power BI model
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The preparation of data is through the Power Query Editor, not with DAX.
    - content: It's used to write functions that build measures, calculated columns, and calculated tables
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: DAX provides analysts the ability to enhance models with calculations.
  - content: What does row context allow you to do in DAX?
    choices: 
    - content: It allows you to define the current row of a table.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: If you create a formula in a calculated column, the row context for that formula includes the values from all columns in the current row.
    - content: It allows you to evaluate your calculation for all values in a visual.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This definition is for the filter context.
    - content: It refers to the subset of data that is implicitly retrieved for a formula
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This definition is for the query context.
  - content: What does filter context allow you to do in DAX?
    choices: 
    - content: It allows you to follow the relationships between tables to determine which rows are associated with any row
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This definition is for relationships.
    - content: It allows you to apply a set of filters to the evaluation of a DAX expression
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Filter context is added when you specify filter constraints on the set of values allowed in a column or table, by using arguments to a formula. Filter context applies on top of other contexts, such as row context or query context.
    - content: It includes the values from all columns in the current row
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This definition is for the row context.
