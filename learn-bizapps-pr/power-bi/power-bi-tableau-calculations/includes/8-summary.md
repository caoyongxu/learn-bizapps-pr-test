In this module, you learned about key DAX calculation concepts. The most important lesson was how context applies to DAX calculations, and the difference between row context and filter context.

You also went through various calculated columns, measures, and calculated tables using DAX functions. The examples you went through should give you the foundation experience to start applying DAX calculations in your work as an analyst.

You were also able to get a better understanding of how your Tableau experiences and calculation knowledge can be applied to future DAX calculations.
