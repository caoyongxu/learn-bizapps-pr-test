To add questions, select the **Datasets** section. All datasets that are associated with the dashboard are displayed. Select the dataset that is associated with your dashboard from the list, select **Featured Q&A questions**, and then select the **Add a question** link. Enter your question or prompt into the input box and then select **Apply**.

When anyone selects the search input box, they'll see your suggested entries at the top of the prompt list. Custom questions are a valuable way to get dashboard users to think about the type of data that is available and how to best use it.
