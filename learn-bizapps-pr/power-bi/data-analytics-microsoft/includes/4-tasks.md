Now that you've looked at the who and the what, it's time to look at the how. You already know that a data analyst is one of several critical roles in an organization, helping uncover and make sense of information to keep the company balanced and operating efficiently. As such, it's vital that you, as a data analyst, clearly understands your responsibility and the tasks that are performed on a near-daily basis. The skillset of a data analyst is essential in helping organizations gain valuable insights into the expanse of data they have, working closely with others in their respective roles in the organization to help bring to light valuable information.

As such, there are five key areas that you'll engage in during the data analysis process.

## Prepare

As a data analyst, you'll probably spend most of your time split between the prepare and model tasks. Bad or incorrect data can have a major impact, resulting in invalid reports, a loss of trust, and can negatively affect business decisions, which lead to loss in revenue, a negative business impact, and more.

Long before a report can be created, data must be prepared. Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming your data to get it ready to model and visualize.

Data preparation is the process of taking raw data and turning it into information that is trusted and understandable. It involves, among other things, ensuring the integrity of the data, correcting wrong or inaccurate data, identifying missing data, converting data from one structure to another or from one type to another, or even something as simple as making data more readable.

Data preparation also involves understanding "how" you're going to get and connect to the data and the performance implications of the decisions. When connecting to data, decisions need to be made to ensure models and reports meet, and perform to, acknowledged requirements and expectations.

Privacy and security are also important. This can include anonymizing data to avoid oversharing or preventing people from seeing personally identifiable information when it isn't needed. Or, removing that data completely if it doesn't fit in with the story you're trying to shape.

Data preparation can often be a lengthy process, which takes a data analyst through a series of steps and methods of preparing the data to put it in proper context and a state that eliminates poor data quality and allows it to be turned into valuable insights.

## Model

Once the data is in a proper state, it's ready to be modeled. Data modeling is the process of determining how your tables are related to each other. This is done by defining, and creating, relationships between the tables. From there, you can enhance the model by defining metrics and adding custom calculations to enrich your data.

Creating an effective and proper data model is a vital and critical step in helping organizations understand and gain valuable insights into the data. An effective data model makes reports more accurate and truthful, allows the data to be explored faster and more efficient, allows the report authoring process to take less time, and makes future report maintenance easier.

It is important to remember that the model is another critical component that has a direct effect on the performance of your report and overall data analysis. A poorly designed model can have a drastically negative impact on the general accuracy and performance of your report. Conversely, a well-designed model with well-prepared data will ensure a properly performant and trusted report. This is even more the case when you are working with data at scale.

From a Power BI perspective, if your report is performing slowly, or your refreshes are taking a long time, you will probably need to revisit the data preparation and modeling tasks to optimize your report.

It should be noted that the process of preparing data and modeling data is an iterative process. Data preparation is the first task in data analysis. Understanding and preparing your data before you model it will make the modeling step much easier.

## Visualize

This task is where you get to bring your data to life! The goal of the visualize task is to ultimately solve business problems. A well-designed report should tell a compelling and impactful story about that data, enabling business decision makers to quickly gain needed insights. Using appropriate visualizations and interactions, an effective report guides the reader through the content quickly and efficiently, allowing the reader to follow a narrative into the data.

The reports created during the visualization task help businesses and decision makers understand what that data means so that accurate and vital decisions can be made. Reports drive the overall actions, decisions, and behaviors of an organization, trusting and relying on the information discovered in the data.

The business may communicate that they need all data points on a given report to make decisions. As a data analyst, you should take the time to really understand the problem the business is trying to solve. Are all data point necessary? Too much data can make it difficult to spot the key points. Having a small and concise data story can help to find insights more quickly.

With the built-in AI capabilities in Power BI, data analysts can build powerful reports, without writing any code, that enables users to get insights and answers and find actionable insights. The AI capabilities in Power BI such as the built-in AI visuals enables the discovering of data simply by asking questions, using the Quick Insights feature, or creating machine learning models directly within Power BI.

An important aspect of visualizing data is designing and creating reports for accessibility. As you build reports, it is important to think about those individuals who will be accessing and reading the reports. Reports should be designed with accessibility in mind from the outset so that no special adoptions are needed down the road and no rework is needed.

Many components of your report will help with storytelling. From a color scheme that is complimentary and accessible, fonts, and sizing, to picking the right visuals for what is being displayed, they all come together to tell that story.

## Analyze

The Analyze task is the important step of understanding and interpreting the information that is displayed on the report. In your role as a data analyst, you should understand the analytical capabilities of Power BI and use those to find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights in such a way that everyone can understand.

Advanced analytics enables businesses and organizations to ultimately drive better decisions throughout the business and create actionable insights and meaningful results. With advanced analytics, organizations can drill down into the data to predict future patterns and trends, identify activities and behaviors, and enable businesses to ask the appropriate questions about their data.

In the past, analyzing data was a difficult and intricate process typically carried out and performed by data engineers or data scientists, but today Power BI puts data analysis at your fingertips, simplifying the data analysis process. Users can quickly gain insights into their data using visuals and metrics directly from their desktop and publish those insights to dashboards so that others can find needed information.

This is another area where the AI integrations within Power BI can take your analysis to the next level. Integrations with Azure Machine Learning, cognitive services and those built-in AI visuals help to enrich your data and analysis.

## Manage

There are many components in Power BI, including reports, dashboards, workspaces, datasets, and more. As a data analyst, you are responsible for the management of these Power BI assets, overseeing the sharing and distribution of items such as reports and dashboards, and ensuring the security of Power BI assets.

Apps can be a valuable distribution method for your content and allow for easier management for large audiences. This also allows you have custom navigation experiences and link to other assets within your organization to complement your reports.

The management of your content helps to foster collaboration between teams and individuals. Sharing and discovery of your content is important for the right people to get the answers they need. Ensuring items are secure is as important. You want to make sure the right people have access and that you are not leaking data past the correct stakeholders.

Proper management can also help reduce data silos within your organization. Data duplication can make things hard to manage as well as introduce data latency when resources are overused. Power BI helps in reducing data silos with the use of shared datasets. Reuse of data that you have prepared and modeled. For key business data, endorsing a dataset as certified can help to ensure trust in that data.

The management of Power BI assets helps reduce the duplication of efforts and ensures the security of the data.
