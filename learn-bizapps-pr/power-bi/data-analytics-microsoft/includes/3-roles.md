As mentioned before, you are not alone. This is a journey and it usually doesn't start with you. The data must come from somewhere. And getting that data into a spot that is usable by you takes some effort and more than likely out of your scope. Especially when we think of the enterprise.

Today's applications and projects can be large and intricate, often utilizing the skills and knowledge of numerous individuals. Each person brings a unique talent and expertise to the table, working together and coordinating tasks and responsibilities in order to see a project through from concept to production.

It wasn't too long ago when roles such as business analysts and business intelligence developers were the de facto norm for data processing and understanding. But the growth and explosion of both the size of data and the different types of data has caused these roles to evolve into more specialized set of skills that modernize and streamline the processes of data engineering and analysis.

The following highlights the different roles in data and the specific responsibility in the overall, end-to-end spectrum of data discovery and understanding.

-   Business analyst

-   Data analyst

-   Data engineer

-   Data scientist

-   Database administrator

## Business Analyst

While there are some similarities between a data analyst and business analyst, the key differentiator between the two roles is what they do with data. A business analyst is closer to the business itself and is a specialist on interpreting the data that comes from the visualization. Often the data analyst and business analyst could be the accountability of a single person.

## Data Analyst

A data analyst enables businesses to maximize the value of their data assets through visualization and reporting tools such as Power BI. Data analysts are responsible for profiling, cleaning, and transforming data, designing, and building scalable and performant data models, and enabling and implementing the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis. They work with the appropriate stakeholders to identify appropriate and necessary data and reporting requirements and then are tasked with turning raw data into relevant and meaningful insights.

A data analyst is also responsible for the management of Power BI assets, including reports, dashboards, workspaces, and the underlying datasets used in the reports. They are tasked with implementing and configuring proper security procedures, in conjunction with stakeholder requirements, to ensure the safekeeping of all Power BI assets and their data.

Data analysts work with data engineers to determine and locate appropriate data sources that meet stakeholder requirements, and work with both the data engineer and database administrator to ensure the data analyst has proper access to the needed data sources. The data analyst also works with the data engineer to identify new processes or improve existing processes for collecting data for analysis.

## Data Engineer

Data engineers provision and set up data platform technologies that are on-premises and in the cloud. They manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. The data platforms they use can include relational databases, nonrelational databases, data streams, and file stores. Data engineers also ensure that data services securely and seamlessly integrate across data services.

Primary responsibilities of data engineers include the use of on-premises and cloud data services and tools to ingest, egress, and transform data from multiple sources. Data engineers collaborate with business stakeholders to identify and meet data requirements. They design and implement solutions.

While there might be some alignment in the tasks and responsibilities of a data engineer and a database administrator, a data engineer's scope of work goes well beyond looking after a database and the server where it's hosted, and likely doesn't include the overall operational data management.

A data engineer adds tremendous value to both business intelligence and data science projects. When the data engineer brings data together, often described as data wrangling, projects move more quickly because data scientists can focus on their own areas of work.

As a data analyst, you work close with a data engineer in making sure that you can access the variety of structured and unstructured data sources, as they will support you in optimizing data models which are typically served from a modern data warehouse or data lake.

Both database administrators and business intelligence professionals can easily transition to a data engineer role. They just need to learn the tools and technology that are used to process large amounts of data.

## Data Scientist

Data scientists perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. Their work can vary from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics. Descriptive analytics evaluate data through a process known as exploratory data analysis (EDA). Predictive analytics are used in machine learning to apply modeling techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns. These are an important part of forecast models.

Descriptive and predictive analytics are just one aspect of data scientists' work. Some data scientists might even work in the realms of deep learning, iteratively experimenting to solve a complex data problem by using customized algorithms.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of the work in a data science project is spent on data wrangling and feature engineering. Data scientists can speed up the experimentation process when data engineers use their skills to successfully wrangle data.

On the surface, it might seem that a data scientist and data analyst are far apart in the work they do, but this not the case. A data scientist looks at data to determine the questions that need answers and often will devise a hypothesis or an experiment and turn to the data analyst to assist with the data visualization and reporting.

## Database Administrator

A database administrator implements and manages the operational aspects of cloud-native and hybrid data platform solutions built on Microsoft Azure data services and Microsoft SQL Server. They are responsible for the overall availability and consistent performance and optimizations of the database solutions. They work with stakeholders to identify and implement the policies, tools, and processes for data backup and recovery plans.

The role of a database administrator is different from the role of a data engineer. A database administrator monitors and manages the overall health of a database and the hardware it resides on, whereas a data engineer is involved in the process of data wrangling, i.e., ingesting, transforming, validating, and cleaning data to meet business needs and requirements.

The database administrator is also responsible for managing the overall security of the data, granting and restricting user access and privileges to the data as determined by business needs and requirements.
