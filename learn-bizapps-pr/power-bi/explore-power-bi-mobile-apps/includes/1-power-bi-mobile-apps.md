Microsoft Power BI offers a set of mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices that enable you to connect to and interact with your cloud and on-premises data when you're on the go, anytime, anywhere. All the reports, dashboards, and apps you have available, either in the cloud in the Power BI service or on-premises on Power BI Report Server, are there.

The mobile apps provide most of the capabilities you have in the Power BI service for viewing, analyzing, and interacting with your data - capabilities such as cross-highlighting, cross-report drillthrough, and filtering. In addition, the mobile apps bring you other capabilities, such as being able to:
* View your data offline.
* Filter reports according to your geographic location.
* Scan barcodes on site to get directly to filtered data.
* Have your report start playing as a slideshow automatically whenever the app is launched (Windows app).

The goal of this module is to introduce some of the main capabilities of the mobile app and explain how the app works. You are strongly encouraged to install the app and follow along with your own reports as you explore the many capabilities of the app.
