After you have a report open in the app, you can start working with it. You can do many things with your report and its data. By tapping and long tapping on the data shown in the report, you can also slice and dice the data. In the report footer, you'll find actions that you can take on the report. 

Some reports have pages that are optimized for mobile viewing and are shown in portrait orientation. Whenever you come to a page that is not optimized for mobile viewing, it usually flips automatically to landscape orientation, and you can view it just as you would in a regular web browser. If the page doesn't flip automatically, the app will prompt you to flip your device to see the page.
