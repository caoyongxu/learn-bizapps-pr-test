In this module, you learned how to use DAX to extend your model designs with calculated tables and calculated columns. You also learned that calculated columns are evaluated within row context, and how to correctly reference columns that belong to different tables. Finally, you learned that while there are many ways to add new columns to your model, that it's best to create Power Query computed columns, whenever possible.
