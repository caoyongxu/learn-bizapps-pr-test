In this module, you learned how to use DAX to extend your model designs with calculated tables and calculated columns. You also learned that calculated columns are evaluated within row context, and you learned how to correctly reference columns that belong to different tables. Finally, you learned that while many ways are available for adding new columns to your model, it's best to create Power Query computed columns whenever possible.
