  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Which statement about calculated tables is true?
    choices: 
    - content: Calculated tables increase the size of the data model.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Calculated tables store data inside the model, and adding them results in a larger model size.
    - content: Calculated tables are evaluated using row context.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Calculated tables aren't evaluated in any context. Calculated columns are evaluated in row context.
    - content: Calculated tables are created in Power Query.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Calculated tables are created in the model using DAX. It's not possible to create a calculated table using Power Query.
    - content: Calculated tables cannot include calculated columns.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Calculated tables can include calculated columns. Columns originate either from the calculated table formula, or from calculated columns you add to the calculated table.
  - content: Which statement about calculated columns is true?
    choices: 
    - content: Calculated columns are created in the Power Query Editor window.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Calculated columns are created in the model by using DAX. Computed columns are created in the Power Query Editor window by using M.
    - content: Calculated column formulas are evaluated using row context.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Calculated column formulas are evaluated using row context.
    - content: Calculated column formulas can only reference columns from within their table.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Calculated column formulas can reference columns from other tables, but they need to use the RELATED or RELATEDTABLE function.
    - content: Calculated columns cannot be related to non-calculated columns.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Calculated columns behave like columns sourced from Power Query. They can be related to any other column in the model, providing it's in a different table.
  - content: You're developing a Power BI desktop model that sources data from an Azure SQL Database. In the database, there's an employee table which stores one row per employee. Each row has a reference to the employee's manager, which is also a row in the employee table. You need to add several columns to the **Employee** table in your model to analyze payroll data within the organization hierarchy. Which technique will you use to add the columns?
    choices: 
    - content: Add persisted columns to a table using T-SQL
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The columns require naturalizing the parent-child relationship into columns. T-SQL doesn't have built-in functions to do this operation.
    - content: Add column expressions in a view using T-SQL
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The columns require naturalizing the parent-child relationship into columns. T-SQL doesn't have built-in functions to do this operation.
    - content: Add computed columns using M.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The columns require naturalizing the parent-child relationship into columns. M doesn't have built-in functions to do this operation.
    - content: IAdd calculated columns using DAX.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: You can use the DAX parent-child functions to naturalize the recursive (employee-manager) relationship into columns.
