  questions: 
  - content: What is the sequence of filtering levels, from highest to lowest, in a Power BI report?
    choices: 
    - content: Dataset (RLS) > Measure > Visual > Page > Report
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: 1.	The order is Dataset (RLS), Report, Page, Visual, and then Measure.
    - content: Dataset (RLS) > Measure > Report > Page > Visual
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: 1.	The order is Dataset (RLS), Report, Page, Visual, and then Measure.
    - content: Dataset (RLS) > Report > Page > Visual > Measure
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Filters are applied to the Dataset (when RLS is enforced), then to the report structure of report, page, visual, and then by measures.
    - content: Dataset (RLS) > Visual > Page > Report > Measure
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: 1.	The order is Dataset (RLS), Report, Page, Visual, and then Measure.
  - content: Which of the following capabilities is unique to the Filters pane?
    choices: 
    - content: Horizontal orientation
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Horizontal orientation can’t be achieved in the Filters pane.
    - content: Relative date filtering
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Search can be achieved with slicers also.
    - content: Single selection
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Single selection can be achieved with slicers also.
    - content: Top N filtering
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Top N filtering can only be achieved in the Filters pane.
  - content: Which of the following capabilities is unique to slicers?
    choices: 
    - content: Horizontal orientation
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Horizontal orientation can only be achieved with slicers.
    - content: Relative date filtering
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Search can be achieved in the Filters pane also.
    - content: Single selection
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Single selection can be achieved in the Filters pane also.
    - content: Top N filtering
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Slicers can’t achieve Top N filtering.
  - content: At the Contoso Skateboard Company, John is responsible for developing a report for the sales director. One report page includes a date slicer and many visuals. When the sales director uses the slicer, all but one of the visuals, a Decomposition Tree visual, should receive the slicer filters. How should John configure the requirement?
    choices: 
    - content: Add a bookmark that doesn’t capture the state of the Decomposition Tree visual.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A bookmark can’t be invoked when a report consumer interacts with the slicer.
    - content: Add a visual-level filter to all but the Decomposition Tree visual.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This configuration would apply the filter to the one visual that should not be filtered. The requirement is for the slicer to filter the page.
    - content: Add a visual-level filter to the Decomposition Tree visual.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This configuration would require that the report consumer apply the filter to each visual. The requirement is for the slicer to filter the page.
    - content: Edit visual interactions.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: By editing visual interactions, John can restrict the slicer from filtering the Decomposition Tree visual.
