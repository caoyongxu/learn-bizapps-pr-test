After you have gained an understanding of how filters work in Power BI reports, you'll be on your way to developing reports that allow report consumers to focus on the data that interests them. The main takeaway is that, at design time, you will have two main techniques to apply filters: the **Filters** pane and slicers. Make sure that you avoid using both techniques in the same report because it can create confusion for your report consumers.

When you're ready to deliver your report, it might be helpful to provide a demonstration (or video) to show how you intend report consumers to use the report. That approach will allow you to show how to apply filters and provide lessons on how to apply interactive filtering actions, such as include/exclude groups, cross filtering, report page drillthrough, and bookmarks.
