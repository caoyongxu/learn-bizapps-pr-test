 title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
 questions: 
  - content: Which query language do you use to extract data from Microsoft SQL Server? 
    choices: 
    - content: DAX
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You would use DAX language with Power BI and Azure Analysis Services. 
    - content: T-SQL
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: True. T-SQL is the query language that you would use for SQL Server.
    - content: MDX
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: False. You would use MDX language with Azure Analysis Services.
  - content: You're creating a Power BI report with data from an Azure Analysis Services Cube. When the data refreshes in the cube, you would like to see it immediately in the Power BI report. How should you connect? 
    choices: 
    - content: Import
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: False. This will import the data into Power BI on a scheduled interval.
    - content: Connect live
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This will reflect cube changes immediately. 
    - content: Direct Query
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This option doesn't exist when connecting to AAS cubes. 
  - content: What can you do to improve performance when you are getting data in Power BI? 
    choices: 
    - content: Do some calculations in the original data source 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Power Query and Power Query Editor are built to allow you to process the data, however, the processing power required to do this may lower performance in other areas of your reports. It is good practice to process as much as possible in the native data source.  
    - content: Only pull data into the Power BI service, not Power BI Desktop 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: False. No performance difference exists between Power BI service and Power BI Desktop. 
    - content: Use the Select SQL statement in your SQL queries when you are pulling data from a relational database. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: False. This approach might decrease performance because you will be getting more columns and rows then youâ€™ll likely need. 
    - content: Combine date and time columns into a single column 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Separating date and time will improve compression and thus performance.
