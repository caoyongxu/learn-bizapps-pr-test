  Cmdlets are functions written in PowerShell script language that execute commands in the Windows PowerShell environment. Running these cmdlets will allow you to interact with your Power BI Platform without having to go through the admin portal in a web browser. Combine these cmdlets with other PowerShell functions to write complex scripts that can optimize your workflow.
