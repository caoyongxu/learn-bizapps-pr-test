The labs in this course are **optional** since they require you to be the administrator of your own Power BI tenant and have [Power BI Premium](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi-premium/). If that is possible for you, please open the [Attendee Lab.pdf](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/power-bi/Attendee%20Lab.pdf) document and go to the Automating Power BI Administration section. 

Complete the lab and return for the Knowledge Check.
