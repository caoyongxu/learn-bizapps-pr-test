PowerShell cmdlets allow you to do similar tasks that you would do with the admin portals but do them in scripting where you can sequentially execute multiple commands or pipe output from one to automate common tasks. With PowerShell cmdlets or the management connectors, you can build flows and apps that help you implement your governance policies. The following is a list of the common Power BI admin tasks that are commonly automated through scripting.

-   List content (workspaces, dashboards, reports, datasets)

-   Write the list to CSV

-   Workspace management

-   Find datasets for a given data source

-   Resolve Power BI Error (show error information)

-   Call other REST APIs

-   Get the Access Token

-   List gateways
