## Create a Key Influencers visual

In this exercise, you'll create a Key Influencers visual around sales, and explore the biggest drivers behind increased/decreased sales.

### Task 1: Create a Key Influencers visual 

In this task, you'll create a basic visual.

1.  From the VISUALIZATIONS panel, select **Key influencers** visual.

1.  From **FIELDS** section, drag and drop **Sales Amount** field from **Measures Table** table to **Analyze**.

1.  From **FIELDS** section, drag and drop **OrderNumber** field from **Sales** table to **Expand by**.

> [!NOTE]
> Use **Expand By** to add fields you want to use for setting the level of the analysis without looking for new influencers.

### Task 2: Expand the Key Influencer analysis 

1.  Move fields that you think might influence **Sales Amount** into the **Explain by** field. You can move as many fields as you want. In this case, start with:

    1.  From **FIELDS** section, **Demographic** field from **Product** table.

        Here are a few questions to answer:

		1.  What **Demographic** contributes to Sales decrease?
		
		1.  What **ProductCategory** contributes to Sales decrease?
		
		1.  What **Product** contributes to Sales increase?
		
		1.  What **Segment** contributes to the highest Sales?
