## Create a Key influencers visual

In this exercise, you'll create a **Key influencers** visual around sales and then explore the biggest drivers behind increased/decreased sales.

### Task 1: Create a Key influencers visual 

In this task, you'll create a basic visual.

1.  From the VISUALIZATIONS panel, select **Key influencers**.

1.  From the **FIELDS** section, drag and drop the **Sales Amount** field from **Measures Table** to **Analyze**.

1.  From the **FIELDS** section, drag and drop the **OrderNumber** field from the **Sales** table to **Expand by**.

> [!NOTE]
> Use **Expand By** to add fields that you want to use for setting the level of analysis without looking for new influencers.

### Task 2: Expand the Key influencer analysis 

Move fields that you think might influence **Sales Amount** into the **Explain by** field. You can move as many fields as you want. In this case, start from the **FIELDS** section, and then select the **Demographic** field from the **Product** table.

In the **Demographic** field, answer the following questions:

1.  What **Demographic** contributes to sales decrease?
		
1.  What **ProductCategory** contributes to sales decrease?
		
1.  What **Product** contributes to sales increase?
		
1.  What **Segment** contributes to the highest sales?

In this lab, you created a **Key influencers** visual and identified the drivers behind sales.
