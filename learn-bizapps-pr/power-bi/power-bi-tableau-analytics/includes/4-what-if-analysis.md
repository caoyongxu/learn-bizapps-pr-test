You can choose the data type that you want to use, along with increments and default values. This feature allows you to manipulate the data to test different scenarios.

In the previous image, you can analyze what might happen to your sales by category if you were to discount at a different percentage. With the same changes to the discount percentage, you can analyze how they would affect your historical value. Furthermore, you could also make assumptions about the relationship between your What If discount amount and the corresponding increase in sales quantity.
