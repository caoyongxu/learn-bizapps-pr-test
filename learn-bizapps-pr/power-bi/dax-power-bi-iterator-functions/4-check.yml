  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: An iterator function always includes at least two arguments. What are they?
    choices: 
    - content: Column and expression
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An iterator function iterates over a table and evaluates an expression for each row of the table. It's not possible to pass in a column reference.
    - content: Table and expression
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: An iterator function iterates over a table and evaluates an expression for each row of the table.
    - content: Measure and expression
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: An iterator function iterates over a table and evaluates an expression for each row of the table. A measure is an expression.
    - content: Table and ranking
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: An iterator function iterates over a table and evaluates an expression for each row of the table. It's not possible to pass in a ranking.
  - content: Which statement about DAX iterator functions is true?
    choices: 
    - content: When used to add values of the same column, the SUM function performs better than the SUMX function.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The SUM function and SUMX function perform the same. Internally, Power BI translates the SUM function as if it were written with the SUMX function.
    - content: When used to add values of the same column, the SUMX function performs better than the SUM function.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The SUM function and SUMX function perform the same. Internally, Power BI translates the SUM function as if it were written with the SUMX function.
    - content: Iterator functions iterate over tables and evaluate an expression for each table row.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Iterator functions iterate over tables and evaluate an expression for each table row.
    - content: Iterator functions iterate over expressions and evaluate tables for each row.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: It's not possible to iterate over expressions. Iterator functions iterate over tables and evaluate an expression for each table row.
  - content: You're developing a Power BI Desktop model. You need to create a measure formula by using the RANKX DAX function to rank students by their test results. The lowest rank should be assigned to the highest test result. Also, if multiple students achieve the same rank, the next student rank should follow on from the tied rank number. Which order and ties arguments should you pass to the RANKX function?
    choices: 
    - content: Order Ascending | Ties Skip
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The highest test result should be assigned the lowest rank. Therefore, the order argument must be Descending. Because no missing rank numbers should exist, the ties argument must be Dense.
    - content: Order Ascending | Ties Dense
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The highest test result should be assigned the lowest rank. Therefore, the order argument must be Descending. Because no missing rank numbers should exist, the ties argument must be Dense.
    - content: Order Descending | Ties Skip
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The highest test result should be assigned the lowest rank. Therefore, the order argument must be Descending. Because no missing rank numbers should exist, the ties argument must be Dense.
    - content: Order Descending | Ties Dense
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: The highest test result should be assigned the lowest rank. Therefore, the order argument must be Descending. Because no missing rank numbers should exist, the ties argument must be Dense.
