## Visualization terminology

When it comes to visualizations, Tableau analysts are comfortable with Tableau sheets, dashboards, and workbooks. These are the components when building a report in Tableau Desktop. The functionality of Tableau and Power BI is the same, things are just named differently in Power BI:

| | **Page** |**Visualization** |**Report** |**Dashboard** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Definition** | Blank canvas for your visualizations and reports. | A single graph, chart, or table. Selected from the Visualization pane. | Collection of visualizations in a single Power BI file. | Collection of Power BI visualizations pinned onto a single view on Power BI service. |
| **Tableau equivalent** | Sheet |  Visualization |Tableau Workbook/Dashboard | No Tableau equivalent |

## Data connection types

There are two connection types in Tableau: live connections and extracts. Both types have their specific uses; one is not better than the other; it is dependent on the use case and its requirements. Live connections offer real-time analysis and use the resources invested on data sources, while extracts are snapshots of data optimized for aggregation and loaded into system memory to be quickly recalled for visualization.

The functionality of Tableau and Power BI connection types offer the same benefits, they're just named differently in Power BI:

| | **Import mode** | **DirectQuery mode** |
|--|--|--|
| **Definition** | Delivers fast performance by importing the data, loading it into memory, and storing it to disk. | Allows analysts to query the data source on request to return results. |
| **Tableau equivalent** | Extracts | Live connection |
