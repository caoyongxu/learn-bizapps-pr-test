Enhancements have been introduced in the new version of usage metrics reports. These enhancements are only available in v2 workspaces. In addition to the previously available user activity metrics, dashboard and report performance metrics have been added. For example, here is a sampling of new performance metrics available in v2 workspaces:

- Report load time
- Average report load time
- Report views
- Unique viewers
- Unused reports

The following is an example of one page of the Usage report v2 - new design.

The new version of the usage metric reports system is built on top of a brand-new infrastructure. That's why the collection and storage of usage information is more reliable and scalable. And it's based on audit events, eliminating previous inconsistencies between the audit log and usage metrics reports.
