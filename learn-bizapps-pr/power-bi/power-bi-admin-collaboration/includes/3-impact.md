Power BI is in the process of fully converting to the new workspace experience designed to simplify workspace creation, make managing workspace membership easier, and lay the foundation for other new capabilities. The original workspace experience was tightly coupled with Office 365 groups, whereas the new workspace experience is not. As the conversion progresses, the following are a few things to be aware of.

- Workspaces v1 and v2 will exist side by side during the migration process.

- You can set different permissions on different kinds of workspaces.

- Setting workspace v2 permissions will not change O365 Groups membership.

- Migration will eventually be required.

- A manual migration is possible during preview (recreate).

- Opt-in migration will be available at general availability (GA).

- Post GA, migration will be mandatory and will happen as soon as Microsoft deems the impact to customers will be minimal.
