Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels on your reports, dashboards, datasets, dataflows, and .pbix files can guard your sensitive content against unauthorized data access and leakage. Labeling your data correctly with sensitivity labels ensures that only authorized people can access your data.

Data sensitivity labels promote data protection by making Power BI authors and consumers aware of data sensitivity.

For more information about sensitivity labels in Power BI, see [Sensitivity labels in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-security-sensitivity-label-overview/?azure-portal=true).

In the Power BI service, you can apply sensitivity labels to reports, dashboards, datasets, and dataflows.

To apply sensitivity labels in the Power BI service:

- You must have a [Power BI Pro license](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro/?azure-portal=true) and edit permissions on the content you wish to label.

- Sensitivity labels must be enabled for your organization. Contact your Power BI admin if you aren't sure about this.

- You must belong to a security group that has permissions to apply sensitivity labels, as described in [Enable sensitivity labels in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-security-enable-data-sensitivity-labels/?azure-portal=true).

- All [licensing and other requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-security-enable-data-sensitivity-labels?azure-portal=true#licensing-and-requirements) must be met.

Power BI can integrate with Microsoft Information Protection and Microsoft Cloud App Security to provide greater control and visibility over sensitive data in Power BI.

All members of the organization can see those labels.

For Power BI data that has a data sensitivity label and is exported to an Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF file, its data sensitivity label goes with it.
