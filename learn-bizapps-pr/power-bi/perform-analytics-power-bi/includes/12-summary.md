In this module, you learned about the emerging power of advanced analytics and discovered how the advanced analytics capabilities of Power BI can bring value to your organization's decision making and strategy formulation.

You enhanced the reports and dashboard you previously created, to enable end-users across your organization to ask more questions and find even more information specific to their teams and work contexts. You used Power BI to explore your data and create a statistical summary of your data to find key takeaways and trends, and identify outliers that might require immediate action. You conducted a time series analysis of your data to see how your data progressed over time, so that you could make observations and forecast behavior. You used the Analyze feature to get Power BI to explain the increases, and show you where the distribution was different, in your data. You built upon the standard visuals in your report by adding custom visuals that helped you to solve additional business problems and display data in more enhanced, animated ways. You went back to Power BI to check for quick insights in your data that you had not already discovered and find more useful insights you could add to your dashboards. Lastly, you used the grouping, binning and clustering techniques to segment and present your data in different ways.

The advanced analytical techniques you applied to your organization's data enabled you to gain new insights in that data, and dive deeper into the data to uncover patters, trends and outliers that you did not know existed. The results of your advanced analysis will empower your organization to make more robust business decisions, plans and forecasts.
