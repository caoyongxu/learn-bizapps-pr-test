Analytics encompasses emerging industry practices, such as data mining, big data analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics. It is a term used to describe the technical aspects of analytics that have predictive capabilities and can be used to solve business problems.

Analytics can transform raw data into an extensive collection of information that categorizes data to identify and analyze behavioral data and patterns. Organizations can use this information to not only analyze the current state of their operations but also to predict future behavior and trends, by asking "what-if" questions. But that's not all it can do. It can help with fraud detection, image recognition, sentiment analysis, and overall general employee productivity. Also, it often replaces cumbersome manual processes.

Imagine asking an employee to figure out what is causing a recent spike in sales. The employee might have to painstakingly comb over each sale, interview customers, talk to sales people, and examine market trends. Instead, you can use the Power BI key influencers visual to use advanced analytics and possibly get to an answer much faster. The visual is only as good as the data you give it, so you'll still have to collect the data and organize it. The actual analytics, however, can easily be done for you, or at least give you an excellent start.

Advanced analytics ultimately enables organizations to make better business decisions and create actionable and meaningful results, by reducing manual work.

Traditionally, data analysis was a complex task carried out by engineers but today, data analysis is more accessible to, and understood by, many people within organizations, across all teams. Power BI is a perfect tool for quickly pulling actionable insights from data. It allows you to build visuals and metrics for your data in reports and dashboards, so that you and the end users can analyze data insights at a high level, and drill down into those insights for more detailed information.

In this module's scenario, you work for Tailwind Traders as a data analyst. You've been tasked with building reports and dashboards that will be used across the organization to aid crucial business decisions. For example, the Product team is interested in learning if there are specific products that are not selling as well as others, the Sales team is focused on sales forecasts for the coming year, and the warehouse team is interested in a general breakdown of the how the warehousing and shipping locations are performing worldwide. For each of these teams, you have to build and share unique reports and dashboards that display high-level insights, as well as visuals developed using advanced analytics.

Power BI's inherent functionality will make it easy for you to tackle this task. You can develop quick insights and share them easily in reports and dashboards with different teams within the organization. The advanced analytics capabilities of Power BI will enable you to identify categories and trends, see how data changes over time, and much more. From this information, you can make predictive data models, and therefore, help your organization to make more robust business decisions, plans, and forecasts.
