To get started using Power Query in Excel, you must first know where to find it.

You can find Power Query in Excel (also known as the Power Query Editor) by following these steps:

1. Go to the **Data** ribbon in Excel.

1. Select the **Get Data** dropdown list.

1. Select the **Launch Power Query Editor** option.

After you've launched Power Query Editor, two windows will display for the Excel application: the Excel workbook and Power Query Editor. We recommend that you maximize the **Power Query Editor** window to full size because the Excel window will be unresponsive with an active **Power Query Editor** window.

The preceding screenshot shows the five key UI areas of the **Power Query Editor** window:

- **Ribbon menu (1)** - Power Query Editor has a ribbon that's similar to other Office applications, including tabs and buttons that are organized across context-sensitive groupings for taking various actions.

- **Queries pane (2)** - Shows the names of the queries that are included with the file. You can create multiple queries in one workbook. Queries can be grouped into folders for organization and management.

- **Formula bar (3)** - Area for the M language code to be shown. This area is disabled by default and can (and should) be enabled on the **View** tab of the ribbon.

- **Preview (4)** - Displays a preview of the results that are generated by the query that is selected in the **Queries** pane, evaluated up through the selected step within the **Query Settings** pane.

- **Query Settings (5)** - Contains the query's name and the list of the applied steps. Each action that is performed by the author will add or update a step in this list. You can navigate to the results of each step, rename them for documentation purposes, and reorder them by using this pane.
