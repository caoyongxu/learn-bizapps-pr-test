## Exercise 1: Use Power Query to connect to CSV - Customers.csv

In this exercise, you will use Excel to connect to a CSV source data file.

### Task 1: Launch Excel

In this task, you will launch a new blank worksheet to get started.

1. Launch Excel.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Excel logo.](../media/lab-excel-logo.png)](../media/lab-excel-logo.png#lightbox)

1. Create a new blank workbook.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the New blank workbook selection screen in Excel.](../media/lab-create-workbook.png)](../media/lab-create-workbook.png#lightbox)

### Task 2: Use Power Query to connect to CSV

In this task, you will connect to the Customers CSV source data file.
1. Select the **Data** tab on the main Excel ribbon.
1. Select **Get Data > From File > From Text/CSV**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Data > From Text/CSV menu option.](../media/lab-data-from-text-csv.png)](../media/lab-data-from-text-csv.png#lightbox)

1. Go to the **C:\ANALYST-LABS\Lab 01\MAIAD Lab 01 - Data Source - Customers.csv** file.

   The **Preview** area will display a sample of the customer's data, column names, and values.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This example is only a preview of the data.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Navigator window showing preview data from Lab 01 - Data Source - Customers.csv, with the Transform Data button highlighted.](../media/5-3-transform.png)](../media/5-3-transform.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Transform Data** button. This will launch the Power Query Editor window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you are working in Power Query, it's best to **maximize** the Power Query Editor window – so that you can see a full view of the Power Query window menus, panes, and options.

1. By default, the **Queries** pane on the left side of the Power Query Editor window will be collapsed. Click on the **arrow** in the Queries pane to expand and open the Queries pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Power Query Editor window with the Queries pane collapsed and the arrow shown to expand the pane.](../media/5-4-expand-pane.png)](../media/5-4-expand-pane.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Queries** pane, right-click the default query name called **MAIAD Lab 01 - Data Source - Customers** and then **Rename** the query to **Customers**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Queries pane open, showing Lab 01 - Data Source - Customers query and the Rename button highlighted.](../media/5-5-rename.png)](../media/5-5-rename.png#lightbox)

    > [!TIP]
    > Queries that will be loaded to use as part of a Data Model should be given a clear, descriptive, user-friendly, noun name that describes what the data represents. For example, Customers, Quotes, Invoices, Products, Geography, etc.

## Exercise 2: Use Power Query transformations to Split Column by Delimiter - Customers

In this exercise, you will use Power Query to extract the First Name from the Contact column.

### Task 1: Use Column from Example

In this task, you will create a new column called **First Name** by using the **Add Column > Column from Examples** transformation to split the **Contact** by a delimiter.

1. From the **Preview** grid, select the **Contacts** column.

1. Then choose from the **Add Column** Tab, the **Column from Examples** down arrow and the **From Selection** option.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Power Query Editor window displaying the Add Column menu options.](../media/5-6-add-column.png)](../media/5-6-add-column.png#lightbox)

    > [!NOTE]
    > This opens a NEW user interface window called “Add Columns From Examples” – this window looks like the Power Query Preview grid, but it is separate window allowing you to type in the proposed value so that Power Query can identify the pattern and formula to apply achieving the end results.

1. In the **Add Column From Examples** window, in the column called **[Column1]**, type the value **"Hugo"** and then enter.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Add Column From Examples window showing Hugo entered in Column1.](../media/5-7-add-from-examples.png)](../media/5-7-add-from-examples.png#lightbox)

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you have pressed the **Enter** key, Power Query will identify if a pattern exists in the data to populate the values for all rows!

1. **Double-click** in the default header called **"Text Before Delimiter"** and rename the new column as **"First Name"**. Select the **OK** button.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Column From Examples window showing the renaming of the default column name to First Name.](../media/5-8-rename.png)](../media/5-8-rename.png#lightbox)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Now, in the Power Query Editor preview grid, you will notice the NEW column called [First Name] – created by parsing out the [First Name] from the [Contact] using the Column from Example transformation!

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Preview grid in Power Query Editor showing the new First Name column.](../media/5-9-first-name.png)](../media/5-9-first-name.png#lightbox)

## Exercise 5: Use Power Query to Clean - Quotes

In this exercise, you will use Power Query transformations to Clean the Quotes data.

### Task 1: Use the Replace transformation

In this task, you will use a replace technique to change the [QuoteDate] to a full date that can be converted to a Date data type.

1. In the Preview window, use a right click on the [QuoteDate] column to display menu options.

1. Next, choose the **Replace Values...** option.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

In this task, you will use the Data Type icon to change the data type from Text to Date.

1. Click on the **ABC** icon that indicates the column is a Text data type.

1. Then choose the **Date** data type option from the data type menu options.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the QuoteDate data format icon selected with the Date data type highlighted.](../media/5-19-data-type.png)](../media/5-19-data-type.png#lightbox)

### Task 3: Close and load to the data model

In this task, you will load the Customers and Quotes tables to the data model.

1. From the **Home** menu, select **Close & Load > Close & Load To...**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > At the point, we have connected to the data sources using Power Query and we have selected the checkbox option to Add this data to the Data Model. However, we have not actually seen where this data has been loaded to. In the next Lab 02A, we will use Power BI Desktop to Import the Power Query connections, Customer table, and Quote table – to create the Data Model.
