Designing a Power BI report involves laying out objects over one or more report pages. While you have a great deal of flexibility in how you do that, what matters most is that you meet requirements by clearly communicating the data to report consumers.

Beyond the correct visual types, you then can consider overlaying analytics options, ordering the visual elements in an intuitive way, and applying suitable format and styling options.
