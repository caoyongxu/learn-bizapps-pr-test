In this unit, you'll open a Power BI report so that you can learn from previous bad data visualization practices.

This report includes six examples of bad data visualization practices. Each example shows a poorly designed visual along with text that describes the issues and reasons for why it's a bad practice. Then, it explains why a different choice of visual is better. Be sure to select the **Good Practice** button to view the improved visual design.

> [!TIP]
> You can maximize the report by selecting the double-headed arrow located in the lower-right corner. When you're ready to return to the module, press the **Esc** key.
