In this module, you have learned about dashboards: what they are, why you need them, and what tiles and pinning are in relation to dashboards. You have also learned how to accomplish several tasks around dashboards, such as:

-   Setting mobile view.

-   Adding a theme to the visuals in your dashboard.

-   Configuring data classification.

-   Adding real-time dataset visuals to your dashboards.

-   Pinning a live report page to a dashboard.

With this new knowledge, consider how you can transform the data that you have to create a story. Dashboards can help you visualize that story.
