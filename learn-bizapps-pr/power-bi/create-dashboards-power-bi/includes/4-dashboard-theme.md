When building dashboards, you should consider ensuring that the same theme is applied to your dashboards to create a cohesive picture. You could also apply a specific theme to reports and dashboards so that all report elements or tiles are uniform. This consideration is particularly important when you are building multiple dashboards. Power BI has the functionality to apply a theme directly to all visuals of a report.

## Themes in Power BI 

A variety of themes are available for use in Power BI service. Go to a dashboard, select the edit drowpdown arrow, and then select **Dashboard theme**.

> [![Selecting dashboard theme on a dashboard](../media/04-dashboard-theme-button-ssm.png)](../media/04-dashboard-theme-button-ssm.png#lightbox)

This selection will open a window, where you can choose from a variety of themes, including **Light** (the default theme), **Dark**, **Color-blind friendly**, and **Custom**, where you can create your own theme. You can also upload your own JSON theme or download the current theme.
