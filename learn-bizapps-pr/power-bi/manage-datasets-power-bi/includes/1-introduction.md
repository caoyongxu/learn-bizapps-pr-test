When your datasets are published to your organization's workspace in Power BI Service, everyone who needs access to those datasets can find them in a central location, and this provides opportunities for collaboration between teams. It also reduces the duplication of effort, as one dataset can be used by multiple users for different business reasons. For instance, one dataset can be used to create multiple Power BI reports. Since preparing and cleaning data can be so time consuming, sharing datasets can be a huge productivity boost for report authors.

This sharing of datasets needs to be actively managed for optimal organizational performance. For example, you can automate the refresh process, so that it becomes more efficient and users always have access to the latest data. You can also promote certain datasets over others, so users can clearly identify the best datasets to use.

The management of datasets also involves the implementation of clever parameters within those datasets, to aid decision making and solve business problems. For example, you can use parameters change the server or database name of your dataset, or a file path for a data source. You can also use parameters to configure incremental refreshes of your data, and to run \'what-if\' scenarios and conduct scenario type analysis on the data.

Another key area of dataset management is setting up and maintaining a gateway, so you and other users can access your on-premises data source from the cloud. You also need to prepare for potential issues that might arise in regards to this gateway, which could interrupt user access to the datasets. The effect of a service connectivity issue could be detrimental to productivity of your users -- if they cannot access the data, they cannot do their jobs, and the organization's decision-making capability is at a standstill. Being prepared to deal with such issues in a timely manner is critical.

Imagine you work as a Power BI Developer for Tailwind Traders and have created reports for multiple teams across the organization. But your work is not done yet, you've just been asked by the report end-users if you can make the reports more dynamic, so they can filter the data themselves, and if you find a way for them to run what-if scenarios. Management has also requested that you take action to guarantee the coherency and integrity of your datasets. They want the datasets available in one place, for future use, and they want you to automate the refresh process, to ensure the data is kept up-to-date.

By the end of this module you'll be able to: 

-   Create dynamic reports with parameters

-   Create what-if parameters

-   Use a Power BI gateway to connect to on-premise data sources

-   Configure a dataset scheduled refresh 

-   Configure incremental refresh settings 

-   Manage and promote datasets

-   Troubleshoot service connectivity

-   Boost performance with query caching (Premium)
