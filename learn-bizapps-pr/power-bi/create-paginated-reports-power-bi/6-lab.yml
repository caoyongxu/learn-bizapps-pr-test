  title: Lab - Create a paginated report 
  description: In this lab, you will use Power BI Report Builder to develop a pixel-perfect paginated report layout that sources data from the AdventureWorksDW2020 SQL Server database. You will create a data source and dataset, and also configure a report parameter. The report layout will allow data to be rendered over multiple pages, and to be exported in PDF and other formats.
