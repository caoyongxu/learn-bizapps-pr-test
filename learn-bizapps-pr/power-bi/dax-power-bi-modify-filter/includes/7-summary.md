In this module, you learned about the important topic of filter context. You also learned why and how to work with the CALCULATE function to modify filter context by passing in filters. These filters can add or overwrite the filter context. And, they can modify filter context when passing in special functions like REMOVEFILTERS or KEEPFILTERS. Lastly, you learned that the CALCULATE function can transition row context to filter context, which can be required when using measure expressions in calculated columns or iterator functions.
