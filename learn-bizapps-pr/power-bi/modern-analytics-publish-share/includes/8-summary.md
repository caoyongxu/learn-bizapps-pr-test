Comments and bookmarks allow report consumers more flexibility in terms of self-service business intelligence and collaboration. Row-level security (RLS) adds the flexibility to share a single report with multiple audiences. Promoted and certified datasets ensure that the target audience is locating and using a single version of truth. Endorsements protect and persist data that is exported from Power BI. Automated refreshes eliminate repetitive tasks for the data modeler. These features empower you to set up governance structures quickly and help you save time for developing data models that lead to additional business insights.
