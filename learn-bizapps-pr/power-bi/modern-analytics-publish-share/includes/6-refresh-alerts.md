A Power BI developer can decide when and how often your data refreshes. The refresh process can be up to eight times each day with a Pro license, up to 48 times each day with Premium, and up to six datasets simultaneously. Scheduled refreshes automatically keep your data up to date by using Power BI Gateway.

You can limit what data is refreshed when you connect to relational database sources (Azure, SQL Server, Oracle, and so on). It's possible to configure only new data to be refreshed and how much to store.

A developer can set up email alerts in Power BI service if a refresh fails or to trigger a flow from Microsoft Power Automate.
