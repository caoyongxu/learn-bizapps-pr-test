Publishing datasets to a workspace makes them available in Power BI service. After datasets have been added to the workspace, the following features are enabled:

-   Reports can be shared with people/groups.

-   New reports can be created within Power BI service.

-   People can use Microsoft Excel to connect to a data model by using the **Analyze in Excel** option.

To publish a report from Power BI Desktop, select **Publish** from the **Home** tab. This function will bring up a window where you can select the target workspace. After selecting the workspace, a success message will appear along with a link for you to select to go to the report in Power BI service.

When you publish from Power BI Desktop to Power BI service, two Power BI artifacts will be available:

-   **Dataset** - The dataset is the data model, which includes queries, tables, relationships, calculated columns, and measures.

-   **Report** - The report pages that are created from the data model.
