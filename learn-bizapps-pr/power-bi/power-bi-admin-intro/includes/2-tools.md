Power BI tools to promote optimal use fall into two categories: Power BI desktop and Power BI service.

## Power BI desktop

- **Power Query Editor** - The Power Query Editor is the primary data preparation experience, where you can connect to a wide range of data sources and apply hundreds of different data transformations by previewing data and selecting transformations from the UI. These data transformation capabilities are common across all data sources, regardless of the underlying data source limitations.

- **Data modeling** - Supports the process of creating a visual representation of a whole information system or parts of it to delineate connections between data points and structures.

- **Visualization** - After you have a data model, you can drag *fields* onto the report canvas to create *visuals*. A visual is a graphic representation of the data in your model. There are many different types of visuals to choose from in Power BI Desktop.

## Power BI service

- **Datasets** - A source of data ready for reporting and visualization.

- **Reports** - Generate reports from the Power BI service from My Workspace or in a new workspace experience. You can also create reports from endorsed datasets. For details on creating reports, refer to this [article](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-discover-across-workspaces/?azure-portal=true).

- **Dashboards** - A single page, often called a canvas, that tells a story through visualizations. For an introduction to creating dashboards through Power BI, refer to this [article](/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards/?azure-portal=true).

- **Workspaces** (v1 and v2) - Workspaces are created on capacities. Essentially, they are containers for dashboards, reports, workbooks, datasets, and dataflows. There are two types of workspaces, *My workspace* and *Workspaces*. My workspace is the personal workspace for any Power BI customer to work with your own content. Workspaces are used to collaborate and share content with colleagues. For more information on workspaces, see this [article](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-basic-concepts/?azure-portal=true).

- **Dataflows** - Reusable transformation logic that can be shared by many datasets and reports. For an introduction to dataflows, refer to this [article](/power-bi/transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-introduction-self-service/?azure-portal=true).
