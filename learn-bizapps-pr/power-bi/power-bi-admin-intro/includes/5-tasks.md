There are several common tasks that are performed by Power BI administrators.

For the **Office 365 global administrator**, these tasks are:

- **Assigning licenses** - In the Power BI service, users have defined capabilities based on the type of per-user license they have (free or Pro) and whether the content they're interacting with is in a workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity. Licenses are assigned in the O365 portal and you must be a global or user - account administrator to assign these licenses.

- **Audit logging** - Gather telemetry data, unique users - launches for Power BI users. For guidance on how to set up audit logs, please refer to this [article](/power-platform/guidance/coe/setup-auditlog/?azure-portal=true).
