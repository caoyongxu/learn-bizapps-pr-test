  questions: 
  - content: What benefit does a Measures table provide?
    choices: 
    - content: It's possible to have the table appear at the bottom of the tables list.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: With a Measures table, you can have the table appear at the top of the tables list.
    - content: It's a dedicated table used to store some or all the measures in the workbook.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This is considered to be best practice since it manages all the measures you create on top of your data.
    - content: It's a dedicated table used to store measures and calculated columns in the workbook.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Calculated columns are tied to a specific table and cannot be stored separately.
  - content: Which concept allows users to type in business descriptions to fields?
    choices: 
    - content: Adding a field description.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Field descriptions are a way to apply business descriptions to measures and columns.
    - content: Changing the format of a field.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Changing the format doesn't add business descriptions, it just changes the field format.
    - content: Setting the default aggregation.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Setting the default aggregation doesn't add any business descriptions. It just changes a default setting for the field.
  - content: What is the difference between groups and bins?
    choices: 
    - content: Bins are an extension of groups, except you can define the bin size and create equally sized groups of values.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Bins are an extension of groups, except you can define the bin size and create equally sized groups of values.
    - content: You can separate some values with bins, while groups take all values.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You aren't segregating some values with bins, you're analyzing all values and creating equally sized bins based on a value you set.
    - content: Text fields only work with bins, while numerical values only work with groups.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You can set the bin size for numerical and time fields only. There's not a specific data type that only works with groups.
