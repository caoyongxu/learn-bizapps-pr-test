  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Which statement about measures is correct?
    choices: 
    - content: Measures store values in the data model.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Unlike calculated tables and calculated columns, measures never store values in the data model.
    - content: Measures must be added to the data model to achieve summarization.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Measure's don't need to be added to the data model. The concept of an implicit measure allows visuals to summarize column values.
    - content: Measures can reference columns directly.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Measures cannot reference columns directly. They can only reference columns which have been passed into functions to summarize column values, like SUM.
    - content: Measures can reference other measures directly.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Measures can reference other measures. It's known as a compound measure.
  - content: Which DAX function can summarize a table?
    choices: 
    - content: SUM
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The SUM function can only summarize a column.
    - content: AVERAGE
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The AVERAGE function can only summarize a column.
    - content: COUNTROWS
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: The COUNTROWS function summarize a table by returning the number of rows.
    - content: DISTINCTCOUNT
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The DISTINCTCOUNT function can only summarize a column.
  - content: Which statement describing similarity of measures and calculated columns in an Import model is true?
    choices: 
    - content: They can achieve summarization of model data.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: A calculated column can be summarized (implicit measure) and a measure always achieves summarization.
    - content: They store values in the data model.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: While calculated columns store their values in the model (when the table is using Import storage mode), measures never store their values in the model.
    - content: They're evaluated during data refresh.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: While calculated columns are evaluated during data refresh time, measures are only evaluated during query time.
    - content: They can be created a quick calculations.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: While measures can be quickly created by using the Quick Measures feature, there's no equivalent feature to create calculated columns.
