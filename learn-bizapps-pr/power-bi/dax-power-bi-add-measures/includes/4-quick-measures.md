Microsoft Power BI Desktop includes a feature named [Quick Measures](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-quick-measures/?azure-portal=true). This feature helps you to quickly perform common, powerful calculations by generating the DAX expression for you.

Many categories of calculations and ways to modify each calculation are available to fit your needs. Moreover, you are able to see the DAX that's generated by the quick measure and use it to jumpstart or expand your DAX knowledge.

In this next example, you'll create another compound measure to calculate profit margin. However, this time, you'll create it as a quick measure.

In the **Fields** pane, select the Sales table. On the **Table tools** contextual ribbon, from inside the **Calculations** group, select **Quick measure**.

In the **Quick measures** window, in the **Calculation** drop-down list, locate the **Mathematical operations** group (you might need to scroll down the list) and then select **Division**.

From the **Fields** list (in the **Quick measures** window), expand the Sales table and then drag the **Profit** measure into the **Numerator** box. Then, drag the **Revenue** measure into the **Denominator** box.

> [![An image shows the Quick Measures window, and configuration of the measure: Numerator is set to Profit; Denominator is set to Revenue.](../media/dax-configure-quick-measure-fields-ssm.png)](../media/dax-configure-quick-measure-fields-ssm.png#lightbox)

Select **OK**. In the **Fields** pane, notice the addition of the new compound measure. In the formula bar, review the measure definition.

```dax
Profit divided by Revenue = 
DIVIDE([Profit], [Revenue])
```

> [!NOTE]
> After the quick measure has been created, you must apply changes in the formula bar.

Rename the measure as **Profit Margin**, and then set the format to a percentage with two decimal places.

Add the **Profit Margin** measure to the matrix visual.
