In this module, you learned that Power BI measures are either implicit or explicit: Implicit measures are an automatic behavior supported by visuals, while explicit measures use DAX formulas to summarize model data.

Explicit measures are an important topic, because they allow you to create sophisticated DAX formulas to achieve the precise calculations your report visuals need. While you learned to create simple and compound measures in this module, you'll learn to create more powerful measures by using iterator functions.
