 title: Add measures to Power BI Desktop models
 description: By the end of this module, you'll be able to work with implicit and explicit measures. You'll start by creating simple measures, which summarize a single column or table. Then you'll create more interesting measures based on other measures in the model. Lastly, you'll be able to describe similarities of, and differences between, a calculated column and a measure.
