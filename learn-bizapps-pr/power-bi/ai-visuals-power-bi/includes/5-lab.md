1. In the **Select a Dataset to Create a Report** window, select the **Sales Analysis** dataset.

1. Click **Create**.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

   You'll now create four report pages, and on each page you’ll work with a different visual to analyze and explore data.

## Exercise 2: Create a scatter chart

In this exercise, you'll create a scatter chart that can be animated.

### Task 1: Create an animated scatter chart

In this task, you'll create a scatter chart that can be animated.

1. Rename **Page 1** as **Scatter Chart**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Page 1 renamed as Scatter Chart.](../media/lab-4-ssm.png)](../media/lab-4-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Add a scatter chart visual to the report page, and then position and resize it so that it fills the entire page.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the scatter chart visualization.](../media/lab-5-ssm.png)](../media/lab-5-ssm.png#lightbox)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the scatter chart on the report page repositioned and resized to fill the page.](../media/lab-6-ss.png)](../media/lab-6-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

    The labs use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It looks like this: **Reseller | Business Type**. In this example, **Reseller** is the table name and **Business Type** is the field name.

    - Legend: **Reseller | Business Type**

    - X Axis: **Sales | Sales**

    - Y Axis: **Sales | Profit Margin**

    - Size: **Sales | Quantity**

    - Play Axis: **Date | Quarter**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the legend, X axis, Y axis, Size, and Play axis fields.](../media/lab-7-ssm.png)](../media/lab-7-ssm.png#lightbox)

    The chart can be animated when a field is added to the **Play Axis** well.

1. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Product | Category** field to the **Filters on this page** well.

1. In the filter card, filter by **Bikes**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the filter card filtered by Bikes.](../media/lab-8-ssm.png)](../media/lab-8-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. To animate the chart, in the bottom-left corner, select **Play**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Play button used to animate the chart.](../media/lab-9-ssm.png)](../media/lab-9-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Watch the entire animation cycle from **FY2018 Q1** to **FY2020 Q4**.

    The scatter chart allows you to see the measure values simultaneously. In this case, you can see order quantity, sales revenue, and profit margin.

    Each bubble represents a reseller business type. Changes in the bubble size reflect increased or decreased order quantities. Horizontal movements represent increases or decreases in sales revenue. Vertical movements represent increases or decreases in profitability.

1. When the animation stops, select one of the bubbles to reveal its tracking over time.

1. Hover the cursor over any bubble to reveal a tooltip that describes the measure values for the reseller type at that point in time.

1. In the **Filters** pane, filter by **Clothing** only, and notice that it produces a different result.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

## Exercise 3: Create a forecast

In this exercise, you will create a forecast to determine possible future sales revenue.

### Task 1: Create a forecast

In this task, you will create a forecast to determine possible future sales revenue.

1. Add a new page, and then rename the page to **Forecast**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the new page renamed Forecast.](../media/lab-10-ssm.png)](../media/lab-10-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Add a line chart visual to the report page, and then reposition and resize it so that it fills the entire page.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the line chart visualization.](../media/lab-11-ssm.png)](../media/lab-11-ssm.png#lightbox)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the line chart added to the report page repositioned and resized to fill the page.](../media/lab-12-ss.png)](../media/lab-12-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

    - Axis: **Date | Date**

    - Values: **Sales | Sales**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Axis and Values fields populated.](../media/lab-13-ssm.png)](../media/lab-13-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Date | Year** field to the **Filters on this page** well.

1. In the filter card, filter by two years: **FY2019** and **FY2020**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the filter card filtered by FY2019 and FY2020.](../media/lab-14-ssm.png)](../media/lab-14-ssm.png#lightbox)

    When forecasting over a time line, you will need at least two cycles (years) of data to produce an accurate and stable forecast.

1. Add the **Product | Category** field to the **Filters on this page** well, and then filter by **Bikes**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the product category filtered by Bikes.](../media/lab-15-ssm.png)](../media/lab-15-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. To add a forecast, beneath the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Analytics** pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Analytics pane under the Visualizations pane.](../media/lab-16-ssm.png)](../media/lab-16-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Expand the **Forecast** section.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Forecast section expand feature.](../media/lab-17-ssm.png)](../media/lab-17-ssm.png#lightbox)

    If the **Forecast** section is not available, it's likely because the visual hasn't been correctly configured. Forecasting is only available when two conditions are met:

    - The axis has a single field of type Date,
    - and only one value field exists.

1. Select **Add**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Add feature in the Forecast section.](../media/lab-18-ssm.png)](../media/lab-18-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Configure the following forecast properties:

    - **Forecast length** - 1 month

    - **Confidence interval** - 80%

    - **Seasonality** - 365

1. Select **Apply**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Apply button on the forecast properties details page.](../media/lab-19-ssm.png)](../media/lab-19-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. In the line visual, notice that the forecast has extended one month beyond the history data.

    The gray area represents the confidence. The wider the confidence, the less stable and, therefore, the less accurate the forecast is likely to be.

    When you know the length of the cycle, in this case annual, you should enter the seasonality points. Sometimes, it could be weekly (7), or monthly (30).

1. In the **Filters** pane, filter by **Clothing** only, and notice that it produces a different result.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

## Exercise 4: Work with a decomposition tree

In this exercise, you will create a decomposition tree to explore the relationships between reseller geography and profit margin.

### Task 1: Work with a decomposition tree

In this task, you'll create a decomposition tree to explore the relationships between reseller geography and profit margin.

1. Add a new page, and then rename the page to **Decomposition Tree**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the new page renamed Decomposition Tree.](../media/lab-20-ssm.png)](../media/lab-20-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. On the **Insert** ribbon, from inside the **AI visuals** group, select **Decomposition Tree**.

    > [!TIP]
    > The AI visuals are also available in the **Visualizations** pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Decomposition Tree on the Insert ribbon.](../media/lab-21-ssm.png)](../media/lab-21-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Reposition and resize the visual so that it fills the entire page.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the visual repositioned and resized to fill the screen.](../media/lab-22-ss.png)](../media/lab-22-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

    - Analyze: **Sales | Profit Margin**

    - Explain by: **Reseller | Geography** (the entire hierarchy)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Analyze and Explain by fields added to the visual wells.](../media/lab-23-ssm.png)](../media/lab-23-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Date | Year** field to the **Filters on this page** well, and then set the filter to **FY2020**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Date Year field filtered by FY2020.](../media/lab-24-ssm.png)](../media/lab-24-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Decomposition Tree** visual, notice that the root of the tree is **Profit Margin** at **-0.94%**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Decomposition Tree visual Profit Margin -0.94%.](../media/lab-25-ss.png)](../media/lab-25-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Select the plus icon (**+**), and in the context menu, select **High value**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the High value from the plus icon.](../media/lab-26-ssm.png)](../media/lab-26-ssm.png#lightbox)

   Notice that the decision tree presents resellers, ordered by highest profit margin.

1. To remove the level, at the top of visual, beside the **Reseller** label, select **X**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the x used to remove the level.](../media/lab-27-ssm.png)](../media/lab-27-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Select the plus icon again and then expand to the **Country-Region** level.

1. Expand from the **United States** to the **State-Province** level.

1. Use the down-arrow located at the bottom of the visual for **State-Province**, and then scroll down to the less profitable states.

1. Notice that **New York** state has negative profitability.

1. Expand from **New York** to the **Reseller** level.

1. Notice that it is easy to isolate root cause.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot example of the root cause isolated.](../media/lab-28-ss.png)](../media/lab-28-ss.png#lightbox)

    **United States** is not producing profit in **FY2020**. **New York** is one state that is not achieving positive profit, and it's due to four resellers paying less than standard costs for their goods.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

## Exercise 5: Work with key influencers

In this exercise, you will use the **Key influencers** AI visual to determine what influences profitability within reseller business types and geography.

### Task 1: Work with key influencers

In this task, you will use the **Key influencers** AI visual to determine what influences profitability within reseller business types and geography.

1. Add a new page, and then rename the page to **Key Influencers**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the new page renamed Key Influencers.](../media/lab-29-ssm.png)](../media/lab-29-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. On the **Insert** ribbon, from inside the **AI visuals** group, select **Key influencers**.

    > [!TIP]
    > AI visuals are also available in the **Visualizations** pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Key Influencers in the Visualizations pane.](../media/lab-30-ssm.png)](../media/lab-30-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Reposition and resize the visual so that it fills the entire page.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the visual resized and repositioned to fill the page.](../media/lab-31-ss.png)](../media/lab-31-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

    - Analyze: **Sales | Profit Margin**

    - Explain by: **Reseller | Business Type** and **Reseller | Geography** (the entire hierarchy)

    - Expand by: **Sales | Quantity**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Analyze, Explain by, and Expand by added to the visual wells.](../media/lab-32-ssm.png)](../media/lab-32-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. At the top left corner of the visual, notice that **Key influencers** is in focus, and the specific influence is set to understand what influences profit margin to increase.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Key influencers in focus with the specific influence set to What influences Profit Margin to increase.](../media/lab-33-ssm.png)](../media/lab-33-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Review the result, which is that the city of **Bothel** is likely to increase.

1. Modify the target to determine what influences the profit margin to *decrease*.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the target modified to determine what influences the profit margin to decrease.](../media/lab-34-ssm.png)](../media/lab-34-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Review the result.

1. To detect segments, in the upper-left corner, select **Top segments**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Top segments selected.](../media/lab-35-ssm.png)](../media/lab-35-ssm.png#lightbox)

1. Notice that the target is now to determine segments when profit margin is likely to be high.

1. When the visual displays the segments (as circles), select one of them to reveal information about it.

1. Review the segment results.

### Task 2: Finish up

In this task, you'll complete the lab.

1. Select the **Scatter Chart** page.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

1. To publish the file to your workspace, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Share** group, click **Publish**.

1. Close Power BI Desktop.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you leave the lab open, it will time out after one to four hours. Your work in the *current* module's lab will be lost, but each lab after the first one includes a PBIX file with the work from all previous labs completed so that you don't need to start over.
