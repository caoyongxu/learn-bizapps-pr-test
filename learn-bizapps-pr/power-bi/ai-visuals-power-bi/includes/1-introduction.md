Power BI gives you a wide range of methods to analyze your data and get answers to your questions. In this module, we will look at Power BI features that are based in advanced analytics and visualization.

Sometimes the fastest way to get an answer is to ask a question in your own words. Power BI allows you to do exactly this with its advanced analytics Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. One feature is it allows you to ask questions using natural language, and it will answer those questions for you.

Similarly, it's likely that your dataset is mainly numerical, it consists of numbers, amounts, measures and so on. You've been successfully analyzing this numerical data to get insights. Traditionally, it has been difficult to analyze non-numerical data but with Power BI's AI capabilities, you can easily analyze text data to get even more insights. For example, you might have a wealth of comments or reviews from customers, or the results of an employee happiness survey that are gathering dust in a database. Now you can analyze this additional data and transform it into valuable information.

Because the numbers don't tell you everything, you can use the AI features in Power BI to dive deeper into your data, to see what are people saying, get more constructive and meaningful results, and therefore, make better business decisions.

Continuing with the scenario from the last unit, where you are building reports for different teams in your organizations, you now want to use the AI aspect of Power BI's advanced analytic capabilities to enhance your reports in clever ways. You want to empower users to gain new insights in more interactive ways, and even get answers to their own questions directly.

This module outlines the AI capabilities of Power BI. By the end of this module you will be able to: 

-   Use the Q&A visual  

-   Find important factors with the Key lnfluencers visual

-   Use the Decomposition Tree visual to break down a measure
