The **Key Influencers** visual helps you understand the factors that are affecting a specific metric. It analyzes your data for you, ranks the factors that matter, and then displays those factors as key influencers. It also helps you to contrast the relative importance of these factors. This means that not only can you build your visuals, but you can also understand what factors impact those visuals, and why the visuals look the way they do.

In this example, you've built several visuals for the Customer Service team and now you're interested in understanding the factors that influence your metrics the most. Specifically, you want to figure out what factors are affecting the total number of logged tickets. One factor might be the client type and another might be location, but you are not sure. The **Key Influencers** visual will find that information for you.

To establish the key influencers, first add the **Key Influencers** visual to your report by selecting the **Key Influencers** icon on the **Visualization** pane. Then, populate the visual with the metrics you want to measure. In this case, as you're interested in the logged tickets, in the **Analyze** field well you add the **Sales** field, and in the **Explain By** field well you add the **City and Product Name** field. The visual updates according to the fields you added, then shows the influence those fields have on your data.

You can now use the "**What influences**..." drop-down list to see what caused the data to **decrease or increase**. In the previous image, you can see that the sales for California are more likely to be $130.7K higher than sales in other cities.
