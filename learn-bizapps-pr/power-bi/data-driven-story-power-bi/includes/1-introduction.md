Organizations use reports to monitor and record performance and identify trends and variances. Organizations rely on the information provided by reports when making decisions. Reports drive organizational behavior and action, at every level, in every aspect.

After you've added visuals to your report, you can make further improvements and fine tune the report before finally sharing it with the report audience. In this module, you'll apply the functions available in Power BI Desktop's report editor to your visuals, to transform your report into a data driven story. You'll provide users with a more effective report layout and navigation experience, and give them additional tools, so they can dive deeper into the information you present in your visuals. You'll then publish the report, so users can access the information they need to make decisions.

Imagine you work as a Power BI Developer for Tailwind Traders. Your managers are finding it difficult to make good business decisions based on the current quality of the reports. Your managers request one report that displays all of the information they need to carry out their yearly planning and forecasting activities, and ultimately make better strategic organizational decisions. They want the report to be concise, accurate, and well-designed, and it must display information in an interesting way that is easy to navigate and complies with current accessibility standards.

You have already made a start on the report by adding and customizing visuals. Now you need to take the report to the next level to meet management's requirements.
