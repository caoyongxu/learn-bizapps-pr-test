Organizations use reports to monitor and record performance and identify trends and variances. When an organization is making decisions, it relies on the information that is provided by reports. Reports drive organizational behavior and action, at every level, in every aspect.

After you've added visuals to your report, you can make further improvements and modify the report before finally sharing it with the report audience. In this module, you'll apply the available functions in the report editor in Power BI Desktop to your visuals, which will transform your report into a data-driven story. You'll provide users with a more effective report layout and navigation experience, and give them additional tools so they can further explore the information that you present in your visuals. Then, you'll publish the report so users can access the information that they need to make decisions.

This module is instructional until you reach the interactive lab.  In this module's scenario, you work as a Power BI developer for Tailwind Traders. Your managers have found it difficult to make good business decisions based on the current quality of the reports. Consequently, your managers have requested one report that displays all the information that they need to accomplish their yearly planning and forecasting activities, ultimately helping them make better, strategic organizational decisions. They want the report to be concise, accurate, and well-designed, and it must display information in a compelling way that is simple to navigate and complies with current accessibility standards.

You have already begun adding and customizing visuals on the report. Now, you need to take the report to the next level to meet management's requirements.

-   Design a report layout.
