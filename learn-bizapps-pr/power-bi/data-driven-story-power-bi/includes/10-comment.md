When you publish your report to Power BI web service, the consumers (users) of your report can add comments to the report. Comments can be useful for personal comments or for starting a conversation about a report item with your colleagues. For example, users can comment on pages or visuals that are experiencing issues with or they could give you suggestions for changes or improvements.

Comments are also available for paginated reports, dashboards and visuals. Anyone with the right permissions can see those comments. When you add a comment to a specific visual rather than the report as a whole, the context of the comment is more clear, and acts like a personal bookmark.

To add or view comment on a report, open the report in the Power BI web service. In the upper-right corner, select **Comments**. In the **Comments** pane, you can see any existing comments and write your own comments, then select **Post Comment**.

To add a comment from a visual, select the visual in the report to open that visual in focus mode. Then select **Comments** from the top menu, and type your comment in the **Comments** pane that displays.
