The managers in your organization were finding it difficult to obtain the information they needed to carry out their yearly planning and forecasting activities, and make good strategic decisions.

You were tasked with creating a concise, well-designed report that displayed information in an interesting way that was easy to navigate and more accessible. You needed to enhance the range of visuals on your report to offer more end-user interaction and detailed information.

Power BI Desktop report editor gave you all the tools you needed to create such a report. You started by considering the best position and size of your visuals and designed the report layout with user accessibility in mind. Next, you applied a selection of buttons, bookmarks, filters and other elements to make the report more visually pleasing, interactive and easier to navigate. You then took time to consider the interactions of the visuals in your report, and made some changes. You added a variety of slicing, filtering and sorting techniques to your data, so users could more easily find the information they needed, at both a high and low detail level. At that stage, you were ready to publish the report to the Power BI Report Server, so it could be accessed by all end-users. You then checked the performance of your report and made some changes to fine-tune the report for optimal performance. Lastly, you designed and published a mobile version of your report.

Imagine if you could not use Power BI Desktop to produce reports. You would be able to analyze the data but you would not be able communicate your findings. Power BI Desktop does more than simply enable you to communicate the data. It allows you to design a range of interesting, powerful reports that can be used for telling data drive stories and aid decision making at all organization levels.

Now that you have published your report, your managers have easy access to up-to-date data that can help them to make more robust plans and accurate forecasts, and ultimately make better business decisions.
