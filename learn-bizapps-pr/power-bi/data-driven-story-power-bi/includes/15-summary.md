Power BI Desktop report editor provides the tools that you need to create a concise, well-designed report that displays information in a compelling and user-friendly, accessible way. Along with creating this well-designed report, in this module, you were tasked with enhancing the range of visuals on your report to offer more user interaction and detailed information.

You started by considering the best position and size of your visuals and designed the report layout with user accessibility in mind. Next, you applied a selection of buttons, bookmarks, filters, and other elements to make the report more visually pleasing, interactive, and easier to navigate. You then considered the interactions of the visuals in your report and made some changes. You added a variety of slicing, filtering, and sorting techniques to your data so that users could find the information that they needed, at both a high and low detail level. At that stage, you published the report to Power BI Report Server so that it could be accessed by all users. Your next task was to check the performance of your report and make changes to fine-tune the report for optimal performance. Finally, you designed and published a mobile version of your report.

If you couldn't use Power BI Desktop to produce reports, you would still be able to analyze the data, but you wouldn't be able to communicate your findings. Power BI Desktop does more than enable you to communicate the data; it allows you to design a range of compelling, powerful reports that can be used for telling data-driven stories and helping with decision making at all organizational levels.

Now that you have published your report, your managers have access to up-to-date data that can help them make more robust plans and accurate forecasts, ultimately helping them to make better business decisions.
