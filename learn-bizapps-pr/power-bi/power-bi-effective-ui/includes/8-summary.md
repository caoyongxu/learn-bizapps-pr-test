A well-designed user interface (UI) delivers a visually appealing report that can be consumed by the widest possible audience.

You've then arrived at the final stage of report development: publication. But before you publish, it's recommended you test the report to ensure report consumer acceptance and satisfaction. Observe how the testers use the report and factor in their feedback to create a polished, final result. Once testing is complete, the report is ready to publish and distribute.
