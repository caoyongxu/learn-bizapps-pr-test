After you've completed the UI enhancements, you're ready to prepare your report for publication. Before you publish the report, you will need to test it. You should also understand how to successfully manage future changes.

## Testing

Make sure that you test your report prior to publication. Undergo user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure that the report meets requirements and report consumer expectations. Be sure to collect and review feedback and implement necessary changes. If possible, observe report consumers working with the report to determine if they use it in the ways that you intended. You might be surprised by what they do and the functionality that they overlook.

Additionally, be sure to test the report by using all possible interfaces, whether it's the Power BI service, a mobile app, or an embedding app.

## Prepare for publication

Before you publish the report, ensure that the state of the report aligns with the intended initial experience. Reset filters and slicers, visual drill state, sort orders, and button state (for buttons that switch visibility of report objects). Lastly, select the first page of the report. Then, you'll be ready to save the report and publish it to Power BI.

## Provide support

Be sure to provide support for your report so that report consumers understand how to best use it. Assistance can be provided in many different ways:

-   Training, which can be informal (such as a lunch meeting) or formal (like a structured course)

-   Recorded demonstration

-   Built-in assistance with an information page, visual header tooltips, or an overlay that is made visible when report consumers select a button

-   Documentation

## Manage change

Often, it's better to publish a new report that includes many updates than release smaller incremental changes. This approach makes it easier for you to inform your audiences of changes. Consider using deployment pipelines to better manage the life cycle of organizational content. For more information, see [Introduction to deployment pipelines](/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview/?azure-portal=true).

Avoid deleting and re-creating a report. It's better to publish and overwrite an existing report so that links and personalized settings continue to work.

Report modifications might invalidate personal bookmarks, personalized visuals, persistent filters, or other per-user data settings (drill state, sort order, and so on). Whenever possible, avoid breaking these personal enhancements because it can contribute to report consumer dissatisfaction.
