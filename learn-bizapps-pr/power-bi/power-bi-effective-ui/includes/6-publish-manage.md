Once you've completed the user interface enhancements, you're ready to prepare for publication. Before you publish the report, it's important to test it. You should also understand how future changes will be successfully managed.

## Testing

It's important that you test your report prior to publication. Undergo User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure the report meets requirements and report consumer expectations. Be sure to collect and review feedback and implement necessary changes. If possible, observer report consumers working with the report to see if they use it in the ways you intended. You might be surprised by what they do and functionality they overlook.

Lastly, be sure to test the report using all possible interfaces, be it the Power BI service, a mobile app, or an app.

## Prepare for publication

Just before you publish the report, ensure that the state of the report aligns to the intended initial experience. Reset filters and slicers, visual drill state, sort orders and button state (for buttons that toggle visibility of report objects). Lastly, select the first page of the report. You're then ready to save the report and publish it to Power BI.

## Provide support

Be sure to provide support for your report so report consumers understand how to best use it. Assistance can be provided in many different ways:

-   Training, either informally, like a brown bag meeting, or formally, like a structured course.

-   Recorded demonstration.

-   Built-in assistance with an information page, visual header tooltips, or an overlay made visible when report consumers click a button.

-   Documentation.

## Manage change

It's often better to publish a new report that includes many updates than release smaller incremental changes. This way, it's easier to inform your audiences of changes. Consider using deployment pipelines to better manage the lifecycle of organizational content. For more information, see [Introduction to deployment pipelines](/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview/?azure-portal=true).

Avoid deleting and recreating a report. It's better to publish and overwrite an existing report. This way, links, and settings continue to work.

Lastly, report modifications may invalidate personal bookmarks, personalized visuals, persistent filters, or other per-user data settings (drill state, sort order, etc.). Whenever possible, avoid breaking these personal enhancements, as it can contribute to report consumer dissatisfaction.
