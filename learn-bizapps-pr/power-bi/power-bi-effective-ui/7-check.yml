  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: At The Contoso Skateboard Company, Iqbal is designing an inventory report. The report includes a line chart visual that has a data series for each warehouse. The visual shows a legend. The report must be accessible to report consumers with visual impairment, particularly for those with color vision deficiencies. How should Iqbal format the line chart visual?
    choices: 
    - content: Assign alt text to the visual using static text.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Alt text with static text can describe the visual but it cannot describe the data series.
    - content: Assign alt text to the visual using a measure.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Alt text with a measure could summarize the data, but that wouldn’t be sufficient to help report consumers distinguish each data series.
    - content: Assign different marker shapes to each data series.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Using different marker shapes will provide a visual clue to distinguish the data series.
    - content: Enable the visual header tooltip icon and set the tooltip text.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The visual header tooltip icon can show a tooltip, but the tooltip text couldn’t adequately describe the data series.
  - content: At The Contoso Skateboard Company, Sally is ready to publish a beta version of a regional sales report in readiness for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). What should Sally do prior to publication?
    choices: 
    - content: Select the initial page and reset filters and slicers.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: 1.	Just before you publish the report, ensure that the state of the report aligns to the intended initial experience. Reset filters and slicers, visual drill state, sort orders and button state (for buttons that toggle visibility of report objects).
    - content: Add an accessible theme.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A theme, whether to optimize accessibility or not, should be added well before publishing the report. Also, an accessible theme can be added by a report consumer while viewing a report (in reading view).
    - content: Record a video to support training.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: It’s too early to record a video because UAT may result in changes.
    - content: Set the page view state.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Scaling the report canvas to fit to page, fit to width, or show actual size supports report authoring and doesn’t affect how the report is rendered.
