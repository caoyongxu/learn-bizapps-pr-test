Relationship structure is an important component of a data modeler's process when creating a report. The structure will impact the size of the overall model and refresh speeds. After the structure has been set up by using best practices, you'll be set up for successful measure creation. Measures give the data modeler access to the important references that are needed to build visuals within Power BI or pivot tables within Excel to tell the story and provide insights.
