With Power BI, you can connect to many different data sources by creating datasets, reports, scorecards, and dashboards that can be shared with others. It is important that critical business data is protected and secure. Power BI has earnedÂ the highest security classifications that are available in the industry, with a foundation built on Microsoft Azure and through feature capabilities such as endorsements and the Microsoft Information Protection setting that is applied in Power BI service.

## Endorsements - certified and promoted datasets

Users can promote a dataset or request that it be certified by the Power BI admin. Anyone can promote a dataset, but only the admin group can set a dataset as certified. Promoted and certified datasets provide users with a single source for retrieving data, encouraging good data practices and empowering users to discover promoted or certified datasets.

To apply the endorsement in Power BI service, select the dataset, select the **More** menu (vertical ellipsis), and then select the **Settings** option.

## Protect data with Microsoft Information Protection

Critical business data needs to be protected, especially when Power BI is used with other applications. Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) provides warning and banners when data is exported by using Analyze in Excel, Power BI Embedded, and Power BI Mobile.

The following demonstration shows that the **Sensitivity** label for the dataset is set to **Highly Confidential**.

The next video shows that the **Highly Confidential** sensitivity label for the dataset persists through when data from the Power BI visual is exported to Excel.
