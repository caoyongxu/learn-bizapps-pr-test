Power BI offers you the ability to highlight which tables from the dataset should be featured connection options within Excel. In the **Model View** of Power BI, you can select one of your tables and then review the **Properties** pane. Tables include a toggle setting that you can enable to make it a featured table. You will need to update the key column section to be a column with unique values and add more details for the user to learn about the contents of the table.

After updating all featured tables that you want included, save and publish the report to Power BI service.

## Featured tables - end user
