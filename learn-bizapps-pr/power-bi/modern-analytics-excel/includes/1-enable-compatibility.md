The Microsoft Power BI suite of tools helps give organizations the freedom to use the analysis tool of their choice when it comes to analyzing information in the dataset. Not every user will have Power BI and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) experience and might not want to learn a new tool.

Excel is still the most widely used analysis tool in the world, and it's the foundation for analytics for most departments. Microsoft recognizes the need to connect the new tools to that foundation. Enabling users to connect to your dataset in Excel will lead to better adoption and greater alignment to a *single version of the truth* when everyone is using the same dataset to answer questions that are related to that part of the business.
