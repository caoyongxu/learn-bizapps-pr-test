Enabling Excel users to connect to datasets will allow for greater adoption of dataset output. This ability can unite an organization to agree on one source of truth and empowers Excel users to have access to larger sets of data than what was previously capped within the traditional tool. The new formulas in Excel add more capabilities for users to be more productive. Though it might be difficult to imagine a world where no one uses Excel, Microsoft has made sure that Power BI and Excel can exist as partners rather than against one another.
