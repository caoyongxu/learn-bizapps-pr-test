If your organization wants to transform the way that it presents data to management and stakeholders, and wants to move from a text and tabular report format to a more visual format, you can use Power BI visuals. These visuals help report users get quicker, easier access to the information that they need to make their business decisions, from a report that is more visually pleasing.

To help your report audience connect and interact with these visuals, you can create a combination of visuals in your Power BI Desktop and then customize those visuals to ensure that they comply with organizational requirements.

Power BI Desktop offers a range of visual options that you can quickly add to your report, and it also gives you the ability to import custom visuals from a rich library that you can use to solve additional business problems. You can select the most effective visuals for your report needs and take advantage of Power BI's formatting options to customize those visuals to meet your organization's requirements.

If Power BI Desktop didn't provide visuals as the means to effectively communicate the insights that you find in your data, your user might find it difficult to access the information that they need and might ultimately struggle to make good business decisions.

Now that you have added visuals to your report, your managers can access the underlying data. The added bonus of a cleverly-designed report in Power BI that contains a variety of visuals is that your managers and all other report users will enjoy the experience of using your report.
