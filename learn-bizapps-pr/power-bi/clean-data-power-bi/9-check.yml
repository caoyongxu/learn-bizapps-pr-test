  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: What is a risk of having null values in a numeric column? 
    choices: 
    - content: DAX expressions that SUM data will be incorrect. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is incorrect. SUM will ignore NULL values and calculate correctly. 
    - content: DAX expressions that MAX data will be incorrect. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This is incorrect. MAX expressions will pick the maximum non-null value. 
    - content: DAX expressions that AVERAGE data will be incorrect. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. AVERAGE takes the total and divides by the number of non-null values. If NULL is synonymous with zero in the data, the average will be higher than the accurate average. 
  - content: If you have two queries that have different data, but you want to concatenate the results into one query with all the combined rows, which operation should you perform? 
    choices: 
    - content: Append 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Append will take two tables and combine it into one query. The combined query will have more rows while keeping the same number of columns. 
    - content: Merge 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This will combine the columns of the two queries, greatly expanding the rows, similar to a SQL JOIN clause. 
    - content: Combine Column 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This is a column operation, not a table operation. 
  - content: Which of the following selections are not best practices for naming conventions in Power BI? 
    choices: 
    - content: Rename columns to have spaces in them. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Spaces make columns and tables easier to read for report users and report authors. 
    - content: Abbreviate column names. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Abbreviations lead to confusion because they are often overused or not universally agreed on. 
    - content: Replace values that have integers with human readable results. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Replacing integer values with text will make it easier for report users and authors to correctly interpret data.
