This module explained how you can take data that is difficult to read, build calculations on, and discover and make it simpler for report authors and others to use. Additionally, you learned how to combine queries so that they were fewer in number, which makes data navigation more streamlined. You also replaced renamed columns into a human readable form and reviewed good naming conventions for objects in Power BI.
