  A Power BI environment is established through the Office 365 admin center and lives within Office 365 containers. The environment consists of Office 365, Azure Active Directory, and Power BI. Azure Active Directory (AAD) provides the backbone of the environment because it's where you create users and assign licenses using AAD functionality.
