Power BI supports two types of accounts. **User** **accounts** are created in the Azure AD tenant. These users can consume content based on access level and license type. (License types will be covered in the next Unit.)

**Guest accounts** are external to the organization. These accounts are part of Azure AD B2B and B2C, and enable users external to the organization to consume or even edit content. The B2C approach allows users with accounts like @gmail and @outlook to view Power BI content.
