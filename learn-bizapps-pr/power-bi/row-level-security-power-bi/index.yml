 title: Implement row-level security
 description: Row-level security allows you to create a single or set of reports that targets data for a specific user. For instance, you can create a single report where a salesperson can only see their individual sales transactions and not the transactions of someone else. RLS can be implemented using either a static or dynamic method and you will learn both here. You will also see how Power BI simplifies testing RLS in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.
