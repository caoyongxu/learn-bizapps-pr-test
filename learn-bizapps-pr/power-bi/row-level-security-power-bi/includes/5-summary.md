In this module, we learned about row-level security, the ability in Power BI to limit what a user sees on a specific report. RLS targets the data to a specific user, for instance, only allowing a manager to see the salary of their direct reports. RLS is implemented with a combination of Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service. To implement RLS, you create a DAX formula that restricts their data access. This makes RLS very versatile. You can use DAX to say that someone can only see records in the United States or sales transactions that are below a certain dollar amount. This programmatic approach means that RLS can be used in a wide-variety of solutions. Once the DAX formula is created in a specific security role, deploy the report and then add users to that role. RLS is an easily implemented, very powerful security feature of Power BI.
