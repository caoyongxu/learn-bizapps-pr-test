Let's quickly review what we covered in this module.

In this module, you learned how, why, and when to use the Power BI service. You used Power BI Home and the navigation pane to find your *content*: dashboards, reports, and apps. You opened a dashboard and added alerts and comments. On that dashboard, you selected tiles to open and view reports. With a report open, you moved between the report pages, changed display options, explored filters and bookmarks, and viewed and exported the underlying data. In the final unit, you learned how to share and collaborate with colleagues. 

<!---TODO: 
This first module provided a solid Power BI foundation that you'll build upon in Module 2.
