3.  The first three options control the display of your report. Select each of the three options to learn how they work.
    *   To display your report page at the largest size possible without resorting to scrollbars, select **Fit to page**.
    *   Too fill the entire width of the available space. Select the **Fit to width**.
    *   To view the report at the best resolution (and if you don’t mind the possibility of double scrollbars), select **Actual size**.

4.  There are several accessibility settings available from the View menu. These setting make reports easier to consume by people with color blindness or other sight challenges. From the **View** menu, select **High contrast colors** and choose one of the options. In the example below, we’ve chosen **High contrast #2**.
