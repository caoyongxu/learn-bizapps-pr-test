Through the past few discussions, you've had the chance to do a myriad of tasks, loading and transforming data from a number of sources, building visuals, creating DAX equations, maybe even publishing a report or two to Power BI Service, but what's next? The next step on our data analysis journey is to share these reports with our wider audiences and organizations. We can do this in a workspace, a feature of Power BI Service. A workspace is a centralized repository in which you can collaborate with colleagues and teams to create collections of reports and dashboards.

Workspaces offer the following benefits:

-   Focus collaboration efforts as workspaces can be used to house reports and dashboards for use by multiple teams.

-   Allow you to share and present reports and dashboards in a single environment.

-   Ensure that the highest level of security is maintained by controlling who can access datasets, reports, and dashboards.

In the following discussions, we will speak on several tasks focused on creating and managing a workspace in Power BI. This includes importing and updating assets in a workspace, configuring data protection, troubleshooting data, and much more. With that, let's get started!
