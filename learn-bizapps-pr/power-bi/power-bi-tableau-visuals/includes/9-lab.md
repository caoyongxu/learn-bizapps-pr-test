In this lab, you'll create your first dashboard in Power BI using the standard visuals in Power BI, including the bar chart and scatter plot. You'll then add interactivity using cross filtering, bookmarks, and the Decomposition tree standard visual. At the end of this lab, you'll create a report like the one shown below.

### Task 17: Arrange and Style

Now that you have the building blocks, use the remaining time to arrange the visuals in a way that tells a story. Here's a couple of tips to get you going:

-   From the **RIBBON** under **View>Themes**, pick a theme to set your colors/font. Then customize the theme to fit your style.
