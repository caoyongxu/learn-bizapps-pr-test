Tap any dashboard to open it. Within a dashboard, you can tap a dashboard tile to focus on it in a larger view. Note any insights that you discover by tapping the **Annotate** button. The Annotate feature allows you to draw on a focused tile to highlight areas of interest. The annotation tools are along the bottom of the screen.
