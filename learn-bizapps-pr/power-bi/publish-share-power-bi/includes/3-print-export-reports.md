Occasionally, you might want to print a report or dashboard for a meeting or for sharing with others. Power BI provides a few ways for you to make these printouts.

In the Power BI service, select **File** in the top-left side of the service and then select **Print this page** to open a print dialog box.

## Export data from a visual

You can also export the data from any visual in the Power BI service. Select the ellipsis on any visual and then select **Export to .csv**.

You can also print or export directly from a report. When you are viewing a report in the Power BI service, select **File > Print** to open the print dialog box.

When you republish a report in the Power BI service, you're prompted to confirm that you want to replace the previous dataset and reports.

When you select **Replace**, the datasets and reports in the Power BI service are overwritten with the new datasets and reports.
