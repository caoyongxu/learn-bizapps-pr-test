An analytical report layout can integrate a guided analytical experience. As a result, the report design is aligned to the automatic and unconscious processes that occur when the report consumer looks at the report.

The guided analytical experience allows navigation between three levels:

- High-level metrics

- Supporting visuals

- Details, when required

**High-level metrics** present single values (cards) or simple visuals that can be quickly understood. These metrics should be related directly to the fundamental requirements of the report. For example, a card in the Contoso Skateboard Store sales report displays a single value for total sales.

**Supporting visuals** can be more complex visuals that provide context to the high-level metrics. They often show groups that break down the metrics, such as by month or product. These visuals can also behave as slicers, allowing the report page to be temporarily filtered by specific visuals, like a specific month or months.

When invoked, the report consumer can *drill to **details***. By drilling to details, the report consumer will be directed to a supplementary report page where they can view granular details. Showing details on a different page removes noise and clutter from the main report page. Drilling into details is also a report design optimization, allowing the report to retrieve a large volume of data only when necessary.

For an example of a guided experience, watch the following video that explores the sales report for the Contoso Skateboard Store.
