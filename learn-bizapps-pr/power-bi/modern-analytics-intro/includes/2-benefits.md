## Benefits of modern analytics

You and your organization will experience daily benefits from modern analytics capabilities, such as **auto refresh**, **nimble response**, **splice sources**, and **capacity & speed**. Additionally, these tools provide you with a competitive edge when you are working with data.

The following sections examine these daily benefits in depth.

Maintaining your existing, traditional Excel spreadsheet reports and keeping them up to date with the latest data is often time-consuming. This labor-intensive process results in businesses frequently having to act on stale information while it simultaneously consumes the analyst's time, limiting innovation and prohibiting real analysis. Auto Refresh capabilities help you keep your data up to date without the need for manual labor. Therefore, rather than expending extra effort, you can apply your time to driving data insights, actions, and real business outcomes.

New reports will take less time to build. Frequently, an analyst will spend hours working on a report and will deliver precisely what was asked for, only to be asked a follow-up question that might require a complete rebuild of the traditional Excel spreadsheet. Contrarily, modern analytics will let you answer follow-up questions with a single click, requiring no time and effort to rebuild. This feature is beneficial, considering that most people aren't certain about what they need until they physically see what they've asked for. Well-built solutions that use modern analytics provide speedy results and near limitless answers to follow up questions, and they empower nimble responses to organizations' most challenging business questions.

Most businesses run on multiple systems. The most valuable business questions are not specific to one silo or system. For example, answering the question, "What is our cash flow forecast for 90 days from now?" might require information from CRM, accounting, and other systems.

Power Query connects to data from disparate business systems and sources to splice, integrate, and shape data to create data models, resulting in end-to-end visibility across your business. Traditional Excel was not built to provide that ability.

Modern Excel has near-limitless data capacity. Traditional Excel is limited to one million rows of data for each sheet but is often slow before you reach one million rows. When you use Excel with Power Query, data model, and Power BI, it routinely handles tens of millions of rows while recalculating in a fraction of the time. This capability unlocks usage patterns that people might not consider in regular Excel, such as loading multiple years' worth of data into a single workbook rather than starting a new workbook each month. This approach saves you time while allowing you to perform analyses that you might not have imagined were possible.
