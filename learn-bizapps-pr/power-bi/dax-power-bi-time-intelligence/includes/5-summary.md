In this module, you learned that time intelligence calculations are concerned with modifying the filter context for date filters. You were introduced to many DAX time intelligence functions, which support the creation of calculations, such as year-to-date (YTD) or year-over-year (YoY). You also learned that life-to-date (LTD) calculations can help you count new occurrences over your fact data, and that snapshot data can be filtered in a way to help guarantee that only a single snapshot value is returned.
