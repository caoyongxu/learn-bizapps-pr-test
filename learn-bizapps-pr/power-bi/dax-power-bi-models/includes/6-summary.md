In this module, you learned that a Power BI model is a source of data that is queried by report and dashboard visuals. You were then introduced to the model structure and how it is comprised of different object types. Power BI models are tabular and the primary object is a table and its columns.

You were then introduced to star schema design principles and how an optimal model classifies tables as fact or dimension. An optimal model is user-friendly and supports high-performance analytic queries, which filter, group, and summarize model data.

Lastly, you learned that *fields* is a collective term that is used for model columns, hierarchy levels, and measures. Fields are used to configure Power BI visuals. When configured with field mappings, a Power BI visual generates an analytic query in the background that it uses to query your model.
