    - content: Column
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A column is contained inside a table and stores values. It does not enforce row-level security.
    - content: Measure
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A measure is a DAX formula that achieves summarization. It does not enforce row-level security.
    - content: Role

    - content: Fact tables must have a unique column.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Fact tables are not required to have a unique column. Dimension tables, however, are required to have a unique column, which is used to create a one-to-many relationship to fact tables.
  - content: In what order does an analytic query implement its phases?
    choices: 
    - content: Filter, Group, Summarize

      explanation: Filter is used to first restrict the data to query. Group then divides the query result into groups. Summarize then produces single value aggregations for each group.
    - content: Group, Filter, Summarize
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Filter takes place before grouping.
    - content: Summarize, Filter, Group
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The correct phase order for an analytic query is Filter, Group, Summarize.
