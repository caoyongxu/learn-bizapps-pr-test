## Summary

In this exercise, you started with an existing Power BI Desktop file that contained a partially completed data model, background, and theme. You completed the data model by creating MANY to ONE relationships from the Quotes Data table to the Customers, Dates, and Offices Lookup tables. Then you created measures on the Quotes table so that you could create a report page with Card, Slicer, Matrix, and a Bullet Chart Custom Visuals. You applied Conditional Formatting to the Matrix visual using Icons and Rules to show within progress towards revenue goal of each District with Office Regions.
