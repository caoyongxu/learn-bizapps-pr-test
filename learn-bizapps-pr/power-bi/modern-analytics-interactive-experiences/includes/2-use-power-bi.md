While Power BI has countless features and gives developers a multitude of ways to interact with their data, Power BI is user-friendly empowering you to quickly create stunning reports. In this unit, you will learn why Power BI is the PowerPoint for Data.

## Power BI -- alignment and grouping

Power BI includes formatting and canvas layout features from PowerPoint to make building well formatted reports straightforward. Some features borrowed from PowerPoint include the following:

- Align visual borders within the canvas.

- Visuals will "snap" into place when they align.

- Visuals can also be distributed horizontally and vertically.

- Group visuals together.

- Ctrl + click (or click + lasso) to select multiple items. Then right click and select **Group.**

- Lasso and group visuals to align and resize.

## Power BI -- themes

You can change the entire theme right from the ribbon similar to PowerPoint. You can use pre-defined themes or import your own custom theme to quickly change the design of the report.
