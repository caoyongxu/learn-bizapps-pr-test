  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You're using Power BI Desktop to develop a model. It has a table named Sales, which includes a column named CustomerKey. In reports, you need a calculation to show the number of different customers who've placed orders. What type of DAX calculation will you add to the Sales table?
    choices: 
    - content: Calculated table
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A calculated table will add a new table to the model. Also, a calculated table can't be added to the Sales table.
    - content: Calculated column
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A calculated column would be added to the Sales table, and this action wouldn't meet the objective of counting different customers.
    - content: Computed column
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A computed column is added using Power Query and has the effect of adding a new column to the Sales table; it isn't a DAX calculation. This action wouldn't meet the objective of counting different customers.
    - content: Measure
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: You can add a measure to the Sales table using the DISTINCTCOUNT DAX function.
  - content: You're using Power BI Desktop to develop a model. It has a table named Customer, which include a column named DateOfBirth. In reports, you need to group customers by their current age. What type of DAX calculation will you add to the Customer table?
    choices: 
    - content: Calculated table
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A calculated table will add a new table to the model. Also, a calculated table can't be added to the Customer table.
    - content: Calculated column
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: A calculated column can store the current age for each customer. This column could then be used in reports to group customers by their age.
    - content: Computed column
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A computed column is added using Power Query, but it isn't a DAX calculation.
    - content: Measure
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A measure cannot be used to group customers by their age.
  - content: You're using Power BI Desktop to develop a model. It has a table named Geography, which has two relationships to the Sales table. One relationship filters by customer region, and the other filters by sales region. Report users need to filter or group Sales table data by either region. What type of DAX calculation will you add to the model?
    choices: 
    - content: Calculated table
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: A calculated table could create a table that duplicates the Geography table data. It could then have an active relationship to the Sales table. Both geography tables would have active relationships to allow report users to filter by customer region or sales region.
    - content: Calculated column
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A calculated column would not allow multiple active relationships between the Geography and Sales tables.
    - content: Computed column
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A computed column would not allow multiple active relationships between the Geography and Sales tables. Also, it's not a DAX calculation.
    - content: Measure
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: A measure would not allow multiple active relationships between the Geography and Sales tables.
