You can add three types of calculations to your data model by using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). They are:

-   Calculated tables

-   Calculated columns

-   Measures

> [!NOTE]
> DAX can also be used to define row-level security (RLS) rules, which are expressions that enforce filters over model tables. Rules, however, aren't considered to be model calculations, so they're out of scope for this module. For more information, see [Row-level security (RLS) with Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-admin-rls/?azure-portal=true).

## Calculated tables

You can write a DAX formula to add a **calculated table** to your model. The formula can duplicate or transform *existing model data*, or create a series of data, to produce a new table. Calculated table data is always imported into your model, so they increase the model storage size and can prolong data refresh durations.

> [!NOTE]
> A calculated table can't connect to external data, you must use Power Query to do that.

Calculated tables can be useful in several scenarios:

-   Date tables

-   Role-playing dimensions

-   What-if analysis

### Date tables

Date tables are required to apply special time filters known as *time intelligence*. A family of DAX functions known as the Time Intelligence functions only work correctly when a date table is setup. When your source data doesn't include a date table, you can easily create one as calculated tables by using the [CALENDAR](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/calendar-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) or [CALENDARAUTO](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/calendarauto-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) DAX functions.

### Role-playing dimensions

When two model tables have multiple relationships, it could be, because your model has a role-playing dimension. Let's consider an example: A table named **Sales** includes two date columns: **OrderDateKey** and **ShipDateKey**. Both columns are related to the **Date** table **Date** column. In this case, the **Date** table is described as a role-playing dimension because it could play the role of *order date* or *ship date*.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![The image shows two tables: Sales and Date. There are two relationships between the tables. Only one relationship is active.](../media/dax-sales-data-relationships-1-ss.png)](../media/dax-sales-data-relationships-1-ss.png#lightbox)

Power BI models only allow one active relationship between tables, which in the model diagram is indicated as a solid line. The active relationship is used by default to propagate filters, in this case from the **Date** table to the **Sales** table **OrderDateKey** column. Any remaining relationships between the two tables are inactive. In a model diagram, they're represented as dashed lines. Inactive relationships are only used when they're expressly requested in a calculated formula by using the [USERELATIONSHIP](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/userelationship-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) DAX function.

Perhaps a better model design could have two date tables, each with an active relationship to the **Sales** table. This way, report users can filter by order date or ship date, or both at the same time. A calculated table can duplicate the **Date** table data to create the **Ship Date** table.

Both relationships are active.](../media/dax-sales-data-relationships-2-ss.png)](../media/dax-sales-data-relationships-2-ss.png#lightbox)

### What-if analysis

Power BI Desktop supports a feature called [What-if parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-what-if/?azure-portal=true). When you create a what-if parameter, a calculated table is automatically added to your model.

What-if parameters allow report users to select or filter by values stored in the calculated table. Measure formulas (discussed later in this unit) can use selected value(s) in a meaningful way. For example, a what-if parameter could allow the report user to select a hypothetical currency exchange rate, and a measure could divide revenue values (in a local currency) by the selected rate.

Importantly, what-if calculated tables aren't related to other model tables because they're not used to propagate filters. For this reason, they're sometimes called *disconnected tables*.

## Calculated columns

You can write a DAX formula to add a **calculated column** to any table in your model. The formula is evaluated for each table row and it returns a single value. When added to an Import storage mode table, it's evaluated when the data model is refreshed, and it increases the storage size of your model. When added to a DirectQuery storage mode table, the formula is evaluated by the underlying source database when the table is queried.

In the **Fields** pane, calculated columns are adorned with a special icon. In the following example, there is a single calculated column in the **Customer** table: **Age**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![The image shows a section of the Fields pane. Inside the Customer table, there are multiple fields. One is adorned with the special icon, which indicates that it's a calculated column.(../media/dax-fields-pane-calculated-column-ss.png)](../media/dax-fields-pane-calculated-column-ss.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> The calculated column special icon is only visible in Power BI Desktop when developing the model. Report users that create a live connection to the model won't see this icon. In fact, there's now way they can determine a column is a calculated column.

## Measures

You can write a DAX formula to add a **measure** to any table in your model. The formula is concerned with achieving summarization over model data. Like a calculated column, the formula must return a single value. Unlike calculated columns, which are evaluated at data refresh time, measures are evaluated at query time and their results are never stored in the model.

In the **Fields** pane, measures are adorned with the calculator icon. In the following example, there are three measures in the **Sales** table: **Cost**, **Profit**, and **Revenue**.

> [![The image shows a section of the Fields pane. Inside the Sales table, there are multiple fields. Three are adorned with the calculator icon, which indicate that they're measures.](../media/dax-fields-pane-measures-ss.png)](../media/dax-fields-pane-measures-ss.png#lightbox)

Sometimes measures can be described as *explicit measures*. To be clear, explicit measures are model calculations written in DAX and commonly they're just called *measures*. Yet, there's the concept of *implicit measures*, too. Implicit measures are columns that can be summarized by visuals in simplistic ways, like count, sum, minimum, maximum, etc. You can easily identify implicit measures in the **Fields** pane because they're adorned with the sigma symbol (âˆ‘).

> [!NOTE]
> Any column can be summarized when added to a visual. So, whether they're adorned with the sigma symbol or not, when added to a visual, they can be configured as implicit measures.

Also, in tabular modeling, there's no such concept as a *calculated measure*. The word *calculated* is used to describe calculated tables and calculated columns. It distinguishes them from tables and columns that originate from Power Query. Power Query doesn't have the concept of an explicit measure.
