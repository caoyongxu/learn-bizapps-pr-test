Data model columns have a set data type, which ensures all column values conform to that data type. Column data types are defined in Power Query, or in the case of calculated columns it's inferred from the formula. Measure data types, liked calculated column data types, are inferred from the formula.

Model data types aren't the same as DAX data types, although there's a direct relationship between them. Model data types and DAX data types are listed in the following table. Notice the supported range of values for each data type.

|     Model data type    |     DAX data type     |     Description                                                                                                                                  |

|     N/A                |     BLANK             |     In some cases, itâ€™s the equivalent of a database (SQL) NULL                                                                                  |

## BLANK data type

The BLANK data type deserves a special mention: DAX uses BLANK for both database NULL and for blank cells in Excel. BLANK doesn't mean zero. Perhaps it's easier to think of it as the "absence of a value".

There are two DAX functions related to BLANK: The [BLANK](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/blank-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) DAX function returns BLANK, while the [ISBLANK](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/isblank-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) DAX function tests whether an expression evaluates to BLANK.
