title: Broaden the reach of Power BI  
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  You can broaden the reach of Power BI by sharing your reports beyond your Power BI environment. You can publish reports to the public internet, embed reports in Microsoft Teams or in PowerApps, and place BI reports in a SharePoint online web part. There's also a special version of Power BI service called Microsoft Power BI Embedded (PBIE) which allows application developers to embed fully interactive reports into their applications without having to build their own data visualizations and controls from scratch.
