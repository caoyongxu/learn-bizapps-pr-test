There are several REST APIs developers can use to build solutions. Azure Active Directory (AD) REST APIs and AD libraries for multiple platforms can be used for authentication. Power BI REST APIs provide programmatic access to objects in a Power BI Report Server catalog and the .NET and JavaScript SDKs can be used to embed reports into an application for your organization.

## NuGet packages

The NuGet client tools provide the ability to produce and consume .NET packages. The NuGet Gallery is the central package repository used by all package authors and consumers.

There are several NuGet packages available to Power BI developers, including:

-   Azure AD Authentication Library - Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory: This package includes the AD Authentication Library (ADAL) and provides the authentication functionality for a .NET client.

-   Power BI .NET SDK - Microsoft.PowerBI.API: This package is a .NET client library for Microsoft Power BI public REST endpoints and provides access to workspaces, content identifiers (GUIDS) for datasets, reports, dashboards, and tiles.

-   JavaScript SDK - Microsoft.PowerBI.JavaScript: This package is a suite of JavaScript web components for integrating Power BI into apps, including the powerbi.js script, referenced by web pages to enable client-side functionality.
