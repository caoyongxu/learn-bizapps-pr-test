Power BI Embedded simplifies Power BI capabilities by helping users quickly add stunning visuals, reports, and dashboards to apps. A Power BI embedded capacity is created in the Azure portal and assigned in the Power BI service. Requirements to provision Power BI embedded capacity include the need to be signed in as a user in the Power BI tenant and have an active Azure subscription. By default, user is signed in as a capacity administrator and therefore can add other users. Once you've provisioned Power BI embedded capacity, you can add more as your needs grow. You can use any combination of Premium capacity SKUs (P1 through P3) within your organization.
