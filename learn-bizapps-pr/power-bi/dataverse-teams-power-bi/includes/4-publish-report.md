For users to access the report in Teams, the report and dataset need to be **Published** to a workspace. A Power BI **workspace** is an area to store reports, workbooks, datasets, and dashboards in the Power BI service. Every Power BI user has a **My workspace** that only they have access to. From **My workspace,** users can share out reports and dashboards. Members of workspaces created in Power BI have access to any reports published to them. For more information about Power BI workspaces, see the links in the Summary unit at the end of the module.
