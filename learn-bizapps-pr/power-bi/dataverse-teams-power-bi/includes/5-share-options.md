## Share a report

Reports published to Power BI workspaces automatically grant access to everybody who is a member of the workspace. If you published the report to **My workspace,** only you have access to the report by default.

> [!NOTE]
> When a user tries to access a Power BI report that they don't have access to, they are prompted through a request access dialog to provide a note explaining their reason for access. The owner of the report receives an email to review the request and approve if appropriate.

To create a share link:

1. Open the report in Power BI for Teams app.

1. Select **Share** from the menu bar.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Power B I app with the Share icon highlighted.](../media/image-42.png)](../media/image-42.png#lightbox)

1. Expand the dialog to define who can use the link. Choose the appropriate settings, then select **Apply.**

    - **People in your organization:** This link grants access to people in your organization. It doesn't work for external users.
    - **People with existing access:** Use this option when you want to generate a link and not change the existing permissions.
    - **Specific people:** This link prompts you to provide the name of specific people, groups, or external guests in your organization's Azure Active Directory. You can't grant access to external users that aren't guests of your organization.
