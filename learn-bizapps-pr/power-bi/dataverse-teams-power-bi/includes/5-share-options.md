## Share a report

Reports that are published to Power BI workspaces automatically grant access to everyone who is a member of the workspace. If you published the report to **My workspace**, only you have access to the report by default.

> [!NOTE]
> When a user tries to access a Power BI report that they don't have access to, they are prompted through a request access dialog box to provide a note that explains their reason for access. The owner of the report will receive an email to review the request and approve if appropriate.

To create a share link, follow these steps:

1. Open the report in the Power BI for Teams app.

1. Set any filters or slicers that you want the recipients to see. The share link will contain this information and users will see the filtered report when using the shared link.

1. Select **Share** from the menu bar.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Power BI app with the Share button highlighted.](../media/image-42.png)](../media/image-42.png#lightbox)

1. Expand the dialog box to define who can use the link. Choose the appropriate settings and then select **Apply**.

    - **People in your organization** - This link grants access to people in your organization. It doesn't work for external users.
    - **People with existing access** - Use this option when you want to generate a link and not change the existing permissions.
    - **Specific people** - This link prompts you to provide the name of specific people, groups, or external guests in your organization's Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can't grant access to external users that aren't guests of your organization.

    >[!Note]
    Use the **Specific people** option to ensure everyone has access when sharing as a tab in a channel, chat, or meeting.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

## Add comments to a report

You can add comments to a report or even on individual visuals on the report. To target comments to individuals, use the **@mention** function to grab their attention.

1. Select **Comment** to open the **Comments** pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

   An email will be sent to the person who is tagged in the **@mention** function.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the email message sent to the person who is tagged in the @mention function.](../media/image-60.png)](../media/image-60.png#lightbox)
