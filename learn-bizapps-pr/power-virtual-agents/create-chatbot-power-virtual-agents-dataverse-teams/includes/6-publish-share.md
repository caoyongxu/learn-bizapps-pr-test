Once the chatbot is ready, it needs to be **published** so that end users can interact with it. Publishing is also required after editing the chatbot and you want end users to be able to access the latest content. By having a published version, you are free to make future updates to the chatbot without impacting end users.

The first time the chatbot is published, only members of the Team that the chatbot is associated with can access it. You can direct them to the chatbot by providing them a link, or adding the chatbot to the **Built by your colleagues** section in Teams.

If the chatbot is for the whole organization, you will submit it for review by your Teams Admin. Once approved, the chatbot will be accessible to all end users and appear in the **Built by your org** section in Teams.

## Publish the chatbot

1. Open the chatbot for editing in the Power Virtual Agents app.

1. Select the **Publish bot** menu option or button.

1. Select the **Publish** button. In the **Publish latest content** confirmation window, select **Publish** to confirm.

If this is the first time the chatbot is published only team members can access it. If the chatbot is only intended for team members, you will need to direct users on how to access it. Select **Share the bot** to select the best method for your situation:

-   **Copy Link:** Send users a link to the chatbot

-   **Add to Teams:** Add the bot to the **Built by your colleagues** section under Teams Apps.
    
> [!NOTE]
> Only team members can use the link or see the chatbot listed in the **Built by your colleagues** in Teams.

1. Select **Save** to close the **Edit details** pane.

## Publish chatbot to organization

For the entire organization to access the chatbot, a **request for admin approval** is needed. This process will send a request to your organizations Teams Admin. Once approved, all end users will have access and the chatbot will appear in the Built by your org section in Teams. Any end users can then discover and install the chatbot through the Teams App store.

To submit the request:

1. Open the chatbot for editing in the Power Virtual Agents app.

1. Select the **Publish bot** menu option or button, then select **Share the bot**.

1. Confirm that the app isn't already published to the app store for Team Members so team members won't see the app twice in the Teams Apps store. Select **Remove** under **Share with my team** if it has been published.
