The primary advantage of a bot is that they provide a personalized natural language conversation with customer just as a human agent would. This allows bots to handle common issues and will free up agents to focus on more complex issues. As they identify the intent of what the customer is saying, they pivot and load subject matter that is most relevant to them. Power Virtual Agents uses topics to provide this content. By modifying a topic's conversation path, organizations ensure that each customer is provided with a personalized and relevant experience. Information supplied by the customer throughout the conversation can be stored for later use. Existing support content can be added as available topics.

We examined how organizations can create and manage Power Virtual Agent topics to provide tailored conversations to customers including:

- Examine how topics are used in Power Virtual Agents to define how conversations between the bot and customer flow.

- Review the topic creation process and how to use conversation nodes to control and define directions the customer can go.

- Explain how entities are used to store different types of data such as names, phone numbers, and dates, so they can be used in various areas of a bot.

- Examine how to use the information captured in entities and store them in variables that can be used throughout your bot.

- Explain when and how you might use a system fall back topic to customize how your bot handles scenarios where it does not recognize content.

- Review the different options available for managing the different topics in your application.

From here, your next step is to gain a deeper understanding of what tools are available to further enhance Power Virtual Agent bot capabilities. This includes how to leverage Power Automate flows, trigger hand offs to live agents, and deploy to different channels.
