The primary advantage of bots is that they provide a personalized natural language conversation with a customer just as a human agent would. This feature allows bots to handle common issues and helps agents focus on more complex issues. As bots identify the intent of what the customer is saying, they pivot and load subject matter that is most relevant to the customer. Power Virtual Agents uses topics to provide this content. By modifying a topic's conversation path, organizations ensure that each customer is provided with a personalized and relevant experience. Information that is supplied by the customer throughout the conversation can be stored for later use. Existing support content can be added as available topics.

This module examined how organizations can create and manage Power Virtual Agents topics to provide tailored conversations to customers, including:

- Explaining how topics are used in Power Virtual Agents to define how conversations between the bot and customer flow.

- Reviewing the topic creation process and how to use conversation nodes to control and define directions for where the customer can go on the conversation path.

- Explaining how entities are used to store different types of data such as names, phone numbers, and dates, so that they can be used in various areas of a bot.

- Examining how to use the information that is captured in entities and how to store it in variables that can be used throughout your bot.

- Explaining when and how you might use a system fallback topic to customize how your bot handles scenarios where it doesn't recognize content.

- Reviewing the different available options for managing the different topics in your application.

Your next step is to gain a deeper understanding of what tools are available to further enhance Power Virtual Agents bot capabilities. This further learning includes how to use Power Automate flows, trigger handoffs to live agents, and deploy to different channels.
