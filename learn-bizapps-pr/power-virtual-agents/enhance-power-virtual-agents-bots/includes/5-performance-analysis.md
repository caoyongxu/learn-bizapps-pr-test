After a bot is deployed and customers are interacting with it, statistics that are related to the bot will become available. You can access this information through the **Analytics** tab in the side navigation pane. On this tab, you can find key performance indicators (KPIs) that show the volume of sessions that your bot has handled, how effectively your bot was able to engage users and resolve issues, escalation rates to human agents, and abandonment rates during conversations. You will also find customer satisfaction information at the KPI level and on the **Customer Satisfaction** tab.

You can also view detailed session history and transcripts by selecting **Sessions** from the **Analytics** tab. On the **Sessions** page, you can download a file with the full session transcript, which can be a helpful way for you to adjust the performance of your bot and change the content in your topics to improve your bot's efficiency.

### Analyze bot performance and usage

The **Summary** page gives you a broad overview of your bot's performance. It uses AI technology to show you which topics have the greatest impact on escalation rate, abandon rate, and resolution rate.

### Analyze session information in Power Virtual Agents

Having access to session information that is related to your bot can help you identify potential changes that need to be made. By default, you can download up to seven days of bot conversation transcript sessions from the past 30 days directly from the Power Virtual Agents portal.

Session transcripts are available by going to **Analytics > Sessions** tab. On the **Sessions** tab, you will be able to see all the different sessions that have been run for the bot. A session represents a conversation that someone had with the bot. If your bot had a high number of sessions, they will be broken down into multiple rows to help make managing the sessions easier. Each row will contain 2500 sessions. You can select each row to download the session transcripts for the specified time frame.
