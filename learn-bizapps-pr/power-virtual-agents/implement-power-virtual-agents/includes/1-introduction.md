Power Virtual Agents lets you build adaptable chatbots that use artificial intelligence (AI). They can solve common customer and internal-facing issues automatically, freeing up staff to focus on complex requests and high-value interactions. You can easily create your own powerful chatbots, without the need for developers or data scientists, by using a guided, no-code graphical interface. Integrate Power Virtual Agents with the products and services you use every day by using hundreds of prebuilt connectors, by building custom workflows using Power Automate, or by creating complex scenarios with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Monitor and continuously improve chatbot performance using AI- and data-driven insights available in an easy-to-read dashboard.

Power Virtual Agents addresses many of the major issues with bot building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the long latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it. It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code. Also, it minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

Using Power Virtual Agents, you can:

- Empower your teams by allowing them to easily build chatbots themselves without needing intermediaries, coding, or AI expertise.

- Reduce costs by easily automating common inquiries and freeing human agent time to deal with more complex issues.

- Improve customer satisfaction by allowing customers to self-help and resolve issues quickly, 24/7 using rich personalized bot conversations.
