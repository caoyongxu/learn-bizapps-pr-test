The best way to monitor the status and diagnose the error of your chatbot is at the topic level.

In **Topics** you see if its status is on or off, if it has any errors and if it's currently being edited by someone.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Topics list with the ChatBot status, errors, and editing values highlighted.](../media/topic-status-errors.png)](../media/topic-status-errors.png#lightbox)

You hover your mouse over the displayed initial to find the full name of the person who is editing

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Mouse hovering the initial displayed under Editing that shows the full name of the person currently editing the topic.](../media/who-is-editing.png)](../media/who-is-editing.png#lightbox)

To diagnose the cause of the error, click on the error in **Topics** and that will take you to the **Setup** page where you can see the error is from the authoring canvas.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Setup page where you can view the errors.](../media/error-status-authoring.png)](../media/error-status-authoring.png#lightbox)

Clicking on the status error number will take you in the canvas where you can see the two errors in the topic checker.

> [![Topic Checker with two errors highlighted.](../media/errors-topic-checker.png)](../media/errors-topic-checker.png#lightbox)
