Topics are the no-code way to create discrete conversation paths that, when used together within a single bot, allow users to have a conversation with a bot that feels natural and flows appropriately.

Topics are siloed in each bot and can't be shared, even if they're part of the same environment. You have the option to copy an existing topic, which is automatically created and saved in the same bot and, by default, the **Status** is set to **Off**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![List of topics with the copy of Lesson 1 highlighted to show that the Status is set to Off.](../media/bot-copy-off.png)](../media/bot-copy-off.png#lightbox)

By default, each bot comes with 12 topics, of which only four can be turned off. The remaining topics will always be turned on and can't be deleted.

You can export and import topics from one environment to another by using solutions and migrating the entire chatbot. In **Solutions**, you can add your existing chatbot and it will include all its topics automatically.
