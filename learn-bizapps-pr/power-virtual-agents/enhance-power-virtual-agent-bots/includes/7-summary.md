With customers demanding more personalized and efficient customer service experiences, organizations are turning to bots. They help provide customers a self-service support solution that can be interacted with through natural language that simulates a human conversation. Bots can easily resolve simple or common issues, allowing agents to focus on more complicated issues that may require more time. With Power Virtual Agents, organizations can easily create powerful bots through a guided, no-code graphical interface. Additionally, organization can easily enhance the bots they create to make them more versatile and support a larger number of situations.
