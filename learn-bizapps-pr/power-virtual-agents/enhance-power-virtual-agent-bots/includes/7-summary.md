Because customers are demanding more personalized and efficient customer service experiences, organizations are turning to bots. Bots help provide customers with a self-service support solution that can be interacted with through natural language that simulates a human conversation. Bots can help resolve simple or common issues, allowing agents to focus on more complicated issues that might require more time. With Power Virtual Agents, organizations can create powerful bots through a guided, no-code graphical interface. Additionally, organizations can enhance the bots that they create to make them more versatile and support a larger number of situations.

This module examined how to enhance your Power Virtual Agents bot to expand how it can be used, including:

- Exploring how to incorporate automation with Power Automate flow to help integrate your bot with other technologies and incorporate that data into your bot.

- Examining how to trigger your virtual agent to hand off a bot conversation to a live agent who is working in applications such as Omnichannel for Customer Service.

- Reviewing how topics can be created automatically from existing content, such as support or FAQ pages.

- Explaining the different analysis capabilities that are available, including working with customer satisfaction details and session information.

Your next step would be to explore other applications that can be used with Power Virtual Agents to create robust customer support solutions, including Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights and Omnichannel for Customer Service.
