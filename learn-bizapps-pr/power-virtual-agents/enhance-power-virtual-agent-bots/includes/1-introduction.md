Power Virtual Agents (PVA) empowers your teams to easily create powerful bots through a guided, no code graphical interface. This allows you to leverage the benefits of bots, without having to rely on data scientists or developers. It helps to address many of the challenges in building bots that exist today. You can eliminate the gap between the subject matter experts and development teams building the bots, as well as latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it. PVA also removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the need to write complex code.

Not only does Power Virtual Agents make it quick and easy to create bots, but it also makes it easy to enhance your bot's functionality to make it even more powerful.

This includes:

- **Execute Power Automate flows:** Initiate Power Automate flows directly from topics in your bot. This allows you to include personalized information for other services in the message content being provided.

- **Pass conversations to live Agents:** Bots can be configured to pass conversations including the context of the conversation to applications such as Omnichannel for Customer Service, where live agents can take over working on it.

- **Automate Topic Creation:** Take content from existing support pages, such as Frequently Asked Questions and quickly turn it into bot topics that can be used in conversations. Topics can also be quickly created from Topics suggested in Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights.

Over the remainder of this module, we will examine some of the additional capabilities available to enhance your Power Virtual Agent bots.
