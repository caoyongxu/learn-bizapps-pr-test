We now use multiple communications channels such as email, web chat, telephone, and social media platforms such as Slack, Teams, and Facebook. Organizations need to be able to contactable by their customers over these multiple channels and further they need to respond consistently in the same manner no matter, which channels a customer decides to use.

Users and customers are becoming more demanding, they require 24x7 response, responses that are tailored to their behaviors and characteristics, and to respond to more complex requests.

Conversational AI is the use of AI powered agents, known as chatbots, to respond to human questions and requests in an intelligent way. Organizations use chatbots to provide the first line of response to customers, handling common inquiries across multiple channels. Chatbots instigate a conversational dialog with the human whether that is over the web or another channel such as the SMS text service.

## Issues around building chatbots

Organizations are going through complex challenges dealing with both employees and customers. Here are some statistics:

- 66% of customers try to use self-service first before contacting an agent. Why? Because contacting an agent takes a long time, you end up in a queue, when you just want an answer straight away.
- 90% of customers expect consistency across channels – on the phone, website, retail store – they want the same treatment.
- 59% of channels are managed in silos; call centers have different incentives than retail stores, the website is managed separately, and so on.

Chatbots can help address all these challenges, but chatbots can be hard to create and expensive to maintain. Traditionally, it takes skill and effort to create a chatbot, you need developers to code the chatbot, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to define the conversational flow, AI specialists to handle the language processing, and the chatbot needs to be able to connect to your back-office systems to access relevant data.

## What are Power Virtual Agents chatbots

Power Virtual Agents is designed to create chatbots whether the user is external (your customers) or internal (your employees). SMEs can build conversational flows using an easy graphical interface, with no code, in a browser. Developers and administrators can assist SMEs in building conversational flows and integrating chatbots with line-of-business applications, using Power Automate cloud flows. Power Virtual Agents includes AI language processing to create natural, conversational AI.

Power Virtual Agents makes it possible for anyone to build a chatbot and greatly reducing the time and cost involved in deploying a chatbot.

## Use cases for chatbots

Conversational AI can be added into application to increase the user experience. Here are some common uses for external chatbots:

- Answering questions or inquiries
- Process return and exchange requests
- Resolving a complaint or problem
- Making a purchase / check inventory / make recommendation / track shipping
- Product onboarding / help desk
- Making a reservation / booking a ticket to an event
- Manage email subscription preferences
- Paying a bill / processing a claim
- Finding a qualified person (for example, professional services)
- Triage for healthcare / crisis communication
- Customer feedback / quizzes, surveys, and competitions

A popular use for chatbots is in customer support scenarios. For example, if you visit the HP support site <https://support.hp.com> a chatbot will assist you with troubleshooting, warranty, and repairs.

Most people's experience of chatbots in customer support scenarios, but there are potentially more powerful use cases for using chatbots inside of an organization such as:

- HR support
- Employee onboarding
- Employee ideas
- Change management
- IT support
- Sales support
- Case management
- Issue management
- Inspections
- Internal process information

Why should you consider building an internal chatbot?

- Consistent internal communication.
- Convenient, quick, and easy.
- Available 24/7.
- Can act on behalf of the user for routine tasks.
- Can replace intranet or internal email for frequently accessed information.

## Solution Architect’s role in determining the need for chatbots

A solution architect should consider using chatbots as part of the solution:

- Consider chatbots to replace web forms, including lead generation forms and inquiry forms.
- Consider a chatbot to help customers navigate and find a person or information, instead of using a website search.
- Chatbots can be used to redirect inquiries to the right person in the organization – customer service agents or professional services staff.

Chatbots are not just for websites. Power Virtual Agents can also be easily deployed to:

- Facebook
- Slack
- Twilio
- Email
- Mobile apps

If the solution architect does decide to use chatbots, the solution architect will need to ensure that the project team follows the principles and best practices for building chatbots as discussed in the remainder of this module.

## Responsible AI

Microsoft has defined six principles for the responsible use of AI. As chatbots are AI-based services, the solution architect needs to keep these in mind when designing chatbots. The Transparency principle is one of the principles that particularly applies to chatbots.

The Transparency principle is concerned with ensuring that the human understands that they are interacting with a chatbot. When a chatbot conversation is started, the chatbot should clearly state that it is a chatbot. The chatbot should state its purpose and limitations for instance by listing out what the scope of what the bot can answer or do. A chatbot should enable the user to escalate or transfer to a human.

Chatbots work well when they are limited solely to their purpose and do not try to be too generic.
