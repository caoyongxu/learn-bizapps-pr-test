Chatbots, if used, are a powerful tool for increasing customer interaction with your solution. A solution architect must ensure that the chatbots are correctly built and meet the requirements.

This section contains recommendations around designing and deploying chatbots.

## Plan a chatbot

When planning a chatbot, the solution architect should:

- Define the scope of the chatbot.
- Define the purpose of the chatbot.
- Define which channels that the bot will be deployed to.
- Define the key metrics and success criteria.
- Verify the topics, entities, and conversational flows.

A chatbot supports three different types of topic:

- Informational
- Tasks
- Troubleshooting

A good Power Virtual Agents chatbot will have a high business impact, that is, a high level of traffic, a low level of integration complexity, and a high level of conversation completion that is achieved without the need for escalation to a human agent.

A well-designed chatbot will have a clearly defined set of goals, where each topic is linked to a business process and has trigger events, a clear set of rules, a set of documents, and a series of tasks that will be performed.

The solution architect might need to provide guidelines for creating topics and trigger phrases for chatbot authors to follow.

## Escalations

With Power Virtual Agents, you can hand off conversations to live agents seamlessly and contextually.

When handing off a conversation, you are sharing the full history of the conversation (the context) and all user-defined variables. Having access to this context means that live agents who are using a connected engagement hub can receive notification that a conversation requires a live agent, see the context of the prior conversation, and resume the conversation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have an engagement hub that is being used by live agents, such as Omnichannel for Customer Service, and you need to configure the connection.

The solution architect should determine when escalation should occur and how escalation will be handled.

Power Virtual Agents chatbots come with telemetry already built-in so that you can monitor how your chatbots are being used. Key KPIs are the rates of abandonment and escalation to a human agent. You should monitor your chatbots and then change them to increase effectiveness.

## Variables

Variables let you save responses from your users in a conversation so that you can reuse them later in other conversations.

The response for each question that is asked in a conversation is stored as a variable. You can then pass the variable to a Power Automate flow or use the variable later in the topic, or even in other topics, to control the questions that are being asked. For example, you can use a variable to decide to skip a question if you have the information that you need at that point.

Variables can be defined as:

- **Topic** - The variable can only be used within its topic.
- **Bot** - The variables can be used by any topic.

Solution architects should encourage chatbot authors to use variables to help improve conversational flow.

## Authentication

You can enable user authentication directly within a Power Virtual Agents bot conversation. User authentication means that you can get a user's basic properties, such as their name and ID, in bot variables. However, you can also prompt a user to sign in by using an authentication node, retrieve a user token for that user, and then use that token to retrieve the user's information from an operating system.

Power Virtual Agents supports the following authentication providers:

- Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Any identity provider that is compliant with the OAuth2 standard, Microsoft account, or Facebook

Power Virtual Agents supports single sign-on (SSO), which means that chatbots can sign in the user if they're on the page where the bot is deployed. You will need to register the web app in Azure AD to enable SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> SSO is only supported on the live website publication channel and the Teams channel.

Solution architects should determine if authentication is required for bots and the identity provider that is used. In many situations, the organization might already have identity providers configured in Azure AD. If you are creating chatbots for Microsoft Teams, then it is simple to configure with the **Only for Teams** option; however, if you are creating chatbots for customers, you might need to consider Azure B2B and Azure B2C for authentication.

## Capacity

When you purchase a Power Virtual Agents license, you will gain capacity for the specified number of billed sessions. Power Virtual Agents will pool this capacity across the entire tenant.

You can monitor how many billed sessions have been used from the **Analytics** tab in the Power Virtual Agents portal.

The solution architect will need to estimate the number of sessions that are required and then ensure that monitoring is implemented to track bot usage and costs.

## Rate limits

Quotas are applied to chatbots to limit how often messages can be sent to the chatbot. The purpose of quotas is to throttle the service load and protect the service from being overloaded.

Quotas for Power Virtual Agents chatbots are defined as requests per minute (RPM). A request is a message from the user to the chatbot, or a message from an Azure Bot Framework Skill, in a single chat session.

The Quota is 600 RPM in the North America region and 800 RPM for the rest of the world.

## Solutions

Power Virtual Agents is solution-aware and can be included in solutions and application lifecycle management (ALM) processes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bots contain many subcomponents, such as **Topics**, that must be exported and imported together. You should consider segmenting your solution and having bots and their subcomponents in a separate solution from other components.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only import and export bots with the Power Virtual Agents web app. The feature is not available in the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams.

## Deployment

Power Virtual Agents is created in a selected environment. You should ensure that you are using the correct environment for development, test, and production purposes when creating chatbots.

If you are using Skills, then you need to define environment variables for each skill.

After deployment of your bot through a solution, you might need to perform certain manual tasks:

- **Power Automate cloud flows** - Configure connections for the first time and the go to the Power Virtual Agents portal and select the bot.
- **Skills** - Add the values for the skills’ environment variables.
- **User authentication** - Configure user authentication in the bot so that it can take actions on the user’s behalf.
- **Escalations** - Configure external services that hand off bot escalations to a human agent.
- **Multichannel** - Configure external channels, such as Facebook, and internal non-Power Virtual Agents services, such as Microsoft Teams.

The solution architect should ensure that these steps are included in the deployment plan for the solution.
