The Return to School apps require their own environment for deployment. The Return to Workplace solution can be obtained and deployed from [AppSource.](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/msemr.pprtwsoln/?azure-portal=true)

For the more experienced Dynamics 365 or Power Platform consultant, the steps should be easy to follow. From a high-level you should complete the following:

1.  Create a Dataverse environment that is unique for this purpose.

1.  Create a portal.

1.  Obtain and install the solution from AppSource.

1.  Configure and publish Return to School dashboard.

1.  Set the security role.

1.  Enable flows.

1.  Set up portal URL environment variable.

If you are looking for detailed steps to complete these tasks, you can find them at Microsoft [docs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/industry/return-to-school/deploy/?azure-portal=true)

Additionally, the expected extensions and platform capabilities are still available to you as a maker in the environment. Extend the configuration as needed but be mindful of the impact to the solutions you have deployed.

Ideas on functionality you could extend include:

-   Editing the portal to include your school colors or mascots

-   Automate the creation of passes to be used for appointments

-   Customizing the information in the notifications

-   Add notifications for administrators to track building traffic

-   Add notifications for janitorial staff to plan for cleaning facilities

-   Add notifications for visitors for appointment and follow-up reminders

-   Modifying cosmetic details in Power Automate flows such as the "from" address on certain notices sent by the system

Ensure you are following best practices including using solutions and following proper ALM practices when building on the Return to School solution.
