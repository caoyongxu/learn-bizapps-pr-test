This is the **second** exercise in a series covering Microsoft Vaccination Management. These labs follow a sequence of presentations that provide an overview of Microsoft Vaccination Management, Microsoft Cloud Solution Center installation, and the accompanying data model. Before beginning this exercise, confirm that you have provisioned an environment with the necessary components installed.

In this exercise, you will learn how to add and manage your data in Microsoft Vaccination Management by using the **Vaccination management** app. The **Vaccination management** app is used by vaccination program administrators to set up and manage eligibility phases, vaccines, doses, and schedules. Vaccination program administrators can also see who has registered, review vaccine inventory, view basic reports on appointments, and see the outcomes of vaccinations.

The **Vaccination management** app has three areas:

-   **Reference Data** - Vaccination program administrators can create and populate data that includes information about vaccines, locations of vaccination sites, and demographics data about registered residents.

-   **Management Data** - Vaccination program administrators can create and populate data that includes information about vaccines and their manufacturer, vaccination providers and their schedules, and vaccination sites and event codes.

-   **Registration Data** - The following data types are entered in this area:

    -   Data for eligibility, resident, and appointment is entered by residents in the Registration and appointment scheduling portal.

    -   Data for vaccinations is entered by vaccination frontline volunteers and nurses in the **Frontline worker** app.

In this exercise, you will learn about these three main areas that help you set up and maintain a vaccination site.
