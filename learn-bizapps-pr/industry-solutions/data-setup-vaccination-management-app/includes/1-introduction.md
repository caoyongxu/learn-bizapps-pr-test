This is the **second** exercise in a series covering Microsoft Vaccination Management (MVM). These labs follow a sequence of presentations covering an overview of Microsoft Vaccination Management, Solution Center installation, and the accompanying Data model. Before beginning this exercise, confirm that you have provisioned an environment with the necessary components installed.

In this exercise you will learn how to add and manage your data in Microsoft Vaccination Management by using the Vaccination Management App. The Vaccination management app is used by vaccination program administrators to set up and manage eligibility phases, vaccines, doses, and schedules. Vaccination program administrators can also see who has registered, review vaccine inventory, view basic reports on appointments, and see the outcomes of vaccinations.

The Vaccine site management app has three areas:

-   Reference Data

    -   Vaccination program administrator creates and populates data that includes information about vaccines, locations of vaccination sites, and demographics data about registered residents.

-   Management Data

    -   Vaccination program administrator creates and populates data that includes information about vaccines and their manufacturer, vaccination providers and their schedules, and vaccination sites and event codes.

-   Registration Data

    -   Data for Eligibility, Resident, and Appointment is entered by residents in the Registration and appointment scheduling portal.

    -   Data for Vaccination is entered by vaccination frontline volunteers and nurses in the Frontline worker app.

In this exercise, you will learn about these three main areas in order to set up and maintain a vaccination site.
