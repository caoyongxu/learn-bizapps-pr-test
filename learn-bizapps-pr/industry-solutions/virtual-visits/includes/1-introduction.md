Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare's Virtual Clinic application allows clinicians to use video conferencing to provide high-quality, personalized, and affordable consultations. Using the entire meetings platform in Microsoft Teams, providers can schedule, manage, and conduct virtual visits with patients. The Virtual Clinic application can then be embedded in Microsoft Teams. It gives a practitioner a full view of their patient's information and history in one unique experience.

After coming home from hiking, Reed noticed he had a new rash on his right arm and leg. He decides to schedule a virtual appointment to get a diagnosis.

In this lab, you'll first play the role of a Lamna Healthcare system administrator. You'll configure the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare Virtual Clinic application to be used for virtual appointments. Then you'll play the role of Reed by scheduling a virtual appointment with his practitioner. Finally, you'll join the virtual appointment from the view of a practitioner to observe the complete end-to-end experience.
