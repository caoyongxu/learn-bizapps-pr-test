In this exercise, you will navigate the Microsoft Vaccination Dashboard and the pages created specifically for enabling insights and awareness about the vaccination program.

### Task 1: Summary Page

In this task, you will explore the **Summary** page. The Summary page of the dashboard provides a high-level overview of the data across your sites, such as the number of doses administered per day for last n number of days, per day average of the doses administered, age-range of people who received the doses, and information about registrations and appointments.

1.  **Filter:** By default, the summary will show the last **7 days**. You can modify this filter to show a longer or shorter time span of data. When you modify the filter, all visualizations will update accordingly.

2.  **Tooltips:** You can **hover** over a visual to see the tooltip for an item, which may have further details.

3.  **Highlight:** You can **select** a data point on a visual and other visualizations will adjust to highlight their associated information. This is different than filtering since all data is visible, but some has now been highlighted and emphasized.

4.  **See more:** You can select the **See more** link in each tile to view detailed information in each page. Select see more on the **Doses administered per day avg.** visual to navigate to Vaccinations.

### Task 2: Vaccinations Page

In this task, you will explore the **Vaccinations** page. The Vaccinations page lets you view the number of doses administered to residents and their demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, race) based on the specified date range, site locations, dose number (1 or 2), and vaccine manufacturer. The page also shows a trend line of the vaccinations administered at the selected sites.

> [![Screenshot of the vaccinations page.](../media/25-vaccination-page.png)](../media/25-vaccination-page.png)

1.  Explore the data on the page and hover, highlight, and filter what you see in the visuals. Expand areas that can show more detail and navigate to various tabs within visuals, such as the Demographics bar chart.

2.  With a small subset of data, it can be harder to see trends. As more people are registered, booked for appointments, and administered their vaccinations, the report visuals will fill out with more data.

3.  After navigating the Vaccinations page, select the Appointments tab in the top under Vaccination Site Management.

### Task 3: Appointments Page

In this task, you will explore the Appointments page. The Appointments page lets you view the number of appointments booked, fulfilled, canceled or no show along with resident's demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, race) based on the specified date range, site location, dose number (1 or 2), and vaccine manufacturer. You can only view appointments data for a single site at a time.

The page also shows a six-week rolling window (two weeks before current week and three weeks after the current week) information about the appointments for the selected site and other filters on the left.

1.  Explore the data on the page and hover, highlight, and filter what you see in the visuals. Expand areas that can show more detail and navigate to various tabs within visuals.

2.  After navigating the Appointments page, select the Registrations tab in the top under Vaccination Site Management.

### Task 4: Registrations Page

In this task, you will explore the Registrations page. The Registrations page lets you view the number of people who registered over time (cumulative), number of people who became eligible, and number of people booked for appointments per day. It also shows registration numbers by resident's demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, race) and by geography (county or postal code).

You can filter information for single or multiple phases.

> [![Screenshot of the registrations page.](../media/27-registration-page.png)](../media/27-registration-page.png)

1.  Explore the data on the page and hover, highlight, and filter what you see in the visuals. Expand areas that can show more detail and navigate to various tabs within visuals.

2.  Notice the Geography map on the form powered by Bing Maps, which has zoomed into the given location on the map.

3.  After navigating the Appointments page, select the Registrations tab in the top under Vaccination Site Management.

### Task 5: Demographics Page

In this task, you will explore the Demographics page. The Demographics page lets you view the number of people vaccinated by geography (county or postal code) and by sex, age, or race.

You can filter information based on the date range, vaccine manufacturer, and the primary dose number (1 or 2).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Sreenshot of the demographics page.](../media/28-demographic-page.png)](../media/28-demographic-page.png)

1.  Explore the data on the page and hover, highlight, and filter what you see in the visuals.

2.  Change the Geography map to postal code and see if any other areas show up.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully navigated the MVM Vaccination Management Dashboard and all the pages in the Report to understand what it all has to offer.
