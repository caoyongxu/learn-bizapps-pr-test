The Events area in Fundraising and Engagement provides nonprofit organizations with capabilities to set up and manage events. In this module we will explore the key components of event management: events, registration packages, ticket registrations, and event tables.

**Events** are created via an Event Setup record. This is where you put together the main components of the event, such as tickets, donations, sponsorships, preferences, and disclaimers.

**Registration Package** represents the package of everything, all tickets and event components, that has been purchased by a donor for an event. Registration packages can be purchased by individuals (contacts) or organizations.

**Ticket Registrations** are created during the registration package process. The system will record one registration per attendee, which will be linked to a registration package, event ticket, and event.

**Event Tables** are linked to an event. Event tables have available places that are filled by registrations.
