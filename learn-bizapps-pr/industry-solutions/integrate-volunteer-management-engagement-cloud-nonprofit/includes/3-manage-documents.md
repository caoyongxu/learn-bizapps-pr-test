With Power Platform's native SharePoint integration,Â you can store related files and documents in Volunteer Management. You can store a range of file types, such as a volunteer profile in Word or PDF format, or a budget for a volunteer engagement as an Excel spreadsheet. This integration allows you to gain easy access to related documents directly from the record in Volunteer Management.
