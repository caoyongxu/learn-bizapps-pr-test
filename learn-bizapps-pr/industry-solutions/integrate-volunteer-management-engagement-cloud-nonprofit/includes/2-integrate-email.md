When you use the messaging in Volunteer Management, it creates a custom message activity, which triggers an email activity, enabling the message to go out as an email. You can synchronize your preferred email system to work with these messages by setting up server-side synchronization. For more information, see the following documentation.

For a richer integrated experience with Microsoft Outlook, you can set up and use the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook. ThisÂ allows you to view volunteer details from Volunteer Management on incoming emails in Outlook, and to track emails and appointments from volunteers back into Dynamics. For more information, see the following documentation.
