Microsoft Common Data Model sits in the heart of Microsoft's Data Platform strategy. It includes a set of standardized, extensible data schemas that Microsoft and its partners have published. This collection of predefined schemas includes entities, attributes, semantic metadata, and relationships. The schemas represent commonly used concepts and activities, such as Accounts, Contacts, Banks, and Financial Holdings, to simplify the creation, aggregation, and analysis of financial data.

A shared schema layer helps accelerate application development, analytics, and data integrations for both operational and analytical scenarios. The merge of the FSI data model into Microsoft Common Data Model is in progress and should be available in the future. Once ready, it will let you browse to the github version of the CDM. It will also let you view the standard table elements with the FSI Data Model and the overall Microsoft Common data Model schema.
