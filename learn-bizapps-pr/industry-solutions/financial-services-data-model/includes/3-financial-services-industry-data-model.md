The Cloud for Financial Services data model has three interconnected layers: **Financial Services Common Data Model**, **Retail banking core data model**, and **Loan onboarding data model**. Each data model layer is used in the solutions and capabilities that are included in Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services.

- [Financial Services Common Data Model](/common-data-model/schema/core/industrycommon/financialservices/financialservicescommondatamodel/overview/?azure-portal=true) layer cuts across all applications, as shown in the preceding illustration.

- [Retail banking core data model](/common-data-model/schema/core/industrycommon/financialservices/retailbankingcoredatamodel/overview/?azure-portal=true) is used by Unified customer profile and Banking customer engagement applications.

- [Loan onboarding data model](/common-data-model/schema/core/industrycommon/financialservices/loanonboardingdatamodel/overview/?azure-portal=true) is used by Customer onboarding and Collaboration manager applications.

This information is critical during design and implementation for identifying the solution dependency on the data model layers.
