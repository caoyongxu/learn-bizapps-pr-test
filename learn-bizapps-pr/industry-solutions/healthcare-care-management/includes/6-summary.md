Then you navigated the Care Management application and patient records to get an overview of how Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare provides a comprehensive 360 view of the patient and how various aspects of clinical data related to a patient are surfaced. Finally, you created a new branch location record associated with an organization to see how data can be created within the Care Management application.
