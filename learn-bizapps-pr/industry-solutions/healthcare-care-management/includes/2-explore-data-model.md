In this exercise, you'll learn about the core Care Management data tables. If you want to explore the tables in more detail on Microsoft Docs, go to [Overview of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare entities](/common-data-model/schema/core/industrycommon/healthcare/healthcare-overview/?azure-portal=true).

The healthcare data model uses some out-of-the-box tables from Dynamics 365 applications. The following healthcare solutions use the built-in Dynamics 365 tables.

|     Healthcare   solution     |     Dynamics 365 tables                                           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Care   Management         |     Account, Activities, Contact, Tasks                           |
|     Home Health               |     Bookings, Incident, Products, Work Order                      |
|     Patient Outreach          |     Lead/Lead Score, Marketing Emails, Contact,   Tasks           |
|     Patient Service Center    |     Agent Script, Knowledge Article, Queues,   Survey Response    |
