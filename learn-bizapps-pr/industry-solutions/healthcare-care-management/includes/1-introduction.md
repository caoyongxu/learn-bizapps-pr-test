With the **Care Management** application, healthcare systems can provide coordinated care to each patient by quickly communicating the right information, at the right time, to the right people. Users can create, personalize, and enable new care plans for patients, manage care teams, and view patients' clinical timelines and care insights, all within the application.

Key capabilities for Care Management include:

-   **Care team** - View and collaborate with care teams to provide the best care for the patient.

-   **Care plan** - Create and assign care plans and automate adherence to improve care coordination for your patients.

-   **Clinical timeline** - Concise, sequential, and interactive view of a patient's clinical occurrences.

-   **Virtual clinic** - Provide your care team members with the ability to perform virtual appointments with patients.

## Industry prioritized scenarios

Care Management focuses on the **Enhance patient engagement** and **Empower health team collaboration** priority scenarios. It creates a system that allows for enhanced care team collaboration and coordination, virtual care options, and a 360-degree view of patient healthcare data with more patient insights.
