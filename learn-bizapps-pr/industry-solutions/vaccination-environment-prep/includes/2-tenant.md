To deploy Microsoft Vaccination Management in a Dataverse environment, you need to add a tenant and the prerequisite licenses.

In this exercise, you will be playing the role of a system administrator and will learn how to create a demo tenant along with the required trial licenses. You can skip this exercise if you have already created a demo tenant and added the trial licenses.

### Task 1: Create a demo tenant

In this task, you will learn how to create a demo tenant along with the required Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Apps trial licenses. You can skip this task if you already have a tenant.

1.  Open an internet browser in **In-Private** or **Incognito** mode.

2.  Go to <https://trials.dynamics.com> and select **Sign up here**.

    > [![Setup page for creating a Dynamics 365 trial.](../media/1-trial.png)](../media/1-trial.png)

3.  A pop-up window will appear, asking if you are a partner or a Microsoft employee. In this case, you're going to select **No, continue signing up**.

4.  Enter your email address and then select **Next**.

5.  Select **Set up account**.

6.  Provide the necessary information. Enter a phone number where you can receive text messages or be called with a verification code to prove that you are not a robot.

7.  After the code has been verified, you can create your new domain, which will be the unique name that is used to identify your Dynamics 365 tenant. Finish creating your business identity user and then sign up for the trial.

8.  Set up a User ID and password in your new domain and then select **Sign up**.

    > [![Set up a User ID and password in your new domain and then select Sign up.](../media/6-identity.png)](../media/6-identity.png)

Your Microsoft 365 tenant has been successfully created along with the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license that includes a Power Apps license as well.

5.  Provide the code and select **Start your free trial**.

    > [![Screenshot to enter verification code for the trial.](../media/11-verify-code.png)](../media/11-verify-code.png)

6.  Select **Try now** and then **Continue** to check out the free trial order.
