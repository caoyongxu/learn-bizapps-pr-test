In this module, you've explored how to manage major moves in Fundraising and Engagement.

The Development area of Fundraising and Engagement enables you to identify prospects and engage donors most likely to support your mission. Opportunities with a guided process flow help you manage major moves, create and track designation plans, goals, reporting plans, and activities. Once the donor is ready to make a commitment, you can convert the opportunity to a pledge or donor commitment, ready to process and track with other gifts in the system.
