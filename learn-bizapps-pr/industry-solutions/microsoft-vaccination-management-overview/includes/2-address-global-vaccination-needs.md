Microsoft Vaccination Management targets the middle-tier market where there are limited doses and high demand. It's not a supply chain management system. Instead it's designed for on-the-ground vaccinators to easily use the system and deliver shots in arms. MVM is a turnkey product designed to strengthen the COVID-19 "last mile" vaccination effort.
