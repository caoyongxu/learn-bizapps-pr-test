Congratulations on learning about Microsoft Vaccination Management!

Microsoft Vaccination Management (MVM) is a configurable solution for healthcare organizations and other vaccine site administrators to connect eligible people with vaccination facilities through online registration and appointment scheduling. The solution also offers vaccine inventory management, an app to check in residents and record vaccinations, and insights about the vaccination program through a centralized dashboard.

Let's review what you've learned:

- Learned how MVM addresses global vaccination needs.

- Explored MVM architecture, capabilities, and personas.

- Examined how MVM integrates with external immunization systems with HL7.
