Congratulations on learning about Microsoft Vaccination Management!

Microsoft Vaccination Management (MVM) is a configurable solution for healthcare organizations and other vaccine site administrators to connect eligible people with vaccination facilities through online registration and appointment scheduling. The solution also offers vaccine inventory management, an app to check in residents and record vaccinations, and insights about the vaccination program through a centralized dashboard.

Let's review what you've learned:

- Learned how MVM addresses global vaccination needs.

- Understood MVM architecture, capabilities, and personas.

- Discovered how MCM integrates with external immunization systems with HL7.
