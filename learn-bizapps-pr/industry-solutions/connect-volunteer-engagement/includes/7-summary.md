In this module, you have seen how the Volunteer Engagement portal is used by volunteers to sign up and manage their participation for engagement opportunities published by your organization. Volunteer Engagement is natively connected to the Volunteer Management app. From the portal, volunteers can apply to participate in engagements, select shifts, and update and add their personal details such as contact information, availability, preferences, and qualifications.
