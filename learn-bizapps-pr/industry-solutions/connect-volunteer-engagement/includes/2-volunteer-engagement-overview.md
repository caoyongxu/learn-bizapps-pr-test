Volunteer Engagement is a self-service portal for volunteers to manage their profiles and engagements. It is natively connected to the Volunteer Management app. Volunteers can use the portal to create and update their volunteer profile with personal details, qualifications, and preferences. They can search for and sign up for engagement opportunities, track their volunteer hours, and view previous and upcoming engagements.

As a volunteer manager, you can use Volunteer Management to post engagement opportunities, which volunteers can sign up to from the Volunteer Engagement portal. All applications made through the portal are automatically received as participation records in Volunteer Management. Using Volunteer Management and Volunteer Engagement together is a fully connected experience for setting up and publishing engagement opportunities and receiving and managing volunteer applications. For information on how to set up engagement opportunities, refer to Module: Manage Engagement Opportunities with Volunteer Management.
