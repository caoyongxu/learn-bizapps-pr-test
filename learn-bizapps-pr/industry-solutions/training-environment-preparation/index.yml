 description: This module will walk you through the process of obtaining a training environment to be used for all the later modules in this Learning Path. The Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services is a conflux of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365. To take full advantage of the Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services solution and the rest of this Learning Path, we recommend having access to both clouds. If you already have a Microsoft 365 tenant and licenses for all Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services apps(/industry/financial-services/configure-cloud-for-financial-services/?azure-portal=true), then you can skip this module and go on to the next module in this Learning Path.
