To deploy Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services in a Microsoft Dataverse environment, you need to create a tenant with the prerequisite licenses.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create a demo tenant. You can skip this exercise if you've already created a demo tenant and have added the trial licenses.
