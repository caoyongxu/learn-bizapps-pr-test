To deploy Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services in a Dataverse environment, you need to create a tenant with the prerequisite licenses.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create a demo tenant. You can skip this exercise if you've already created a demo tenant and added the trial licenses.

## Task 1: Create a Microsoft 365 tenant

In this task, you'll learn how to create a trial tenant along with the required Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 trial licenses. You can skip this task if you already have a tenant.

1. Open an internet browser in In-Private or Incognito mode.

1. Go to [https://trials.dynamics.com](https://trials.dynamics.com/?azure-portal=true), scroll down, and select **Try for free** in the **Dynamics 365 Customer Service** card.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Service tab with Dynamics 365 Customer Service selected.](../media/service.png)](../media/service.png#lightbox)

1. A pop-up window will appear, asking you to enter your email to start your free trial. Leave the Email ID field blank and select **Start your free trial**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the dialog with the Start your free trial button selected.](../media/start.png)](../media/start.png#lightbox)

1. You'll be shown an error asking you to provide a valid work or school email ID with a link below to select to set up a new trial account instead. Select **Click here to set up a new trial account instead**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the error with the link below.](../media/new-trial.png)](../media/new-trial.png#lightbox)

1. This will lead to a new account creation flow for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan. Get started by entering your email address.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan Trial wizard email page.](../media/email.png)](../media/email.png#lightbox)

1. If the email is already using other Microsoft Services, the following warning will appear.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the warning "Looks like you're already using this email with another Microsoft service."](../media/warning.png)](../media/warning.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Create a new account instead**. It will open the following page. Provide the necessary information. Enter a valid phone number where you can receive text message to validate the sign-up process.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Tell us about yourself page of the wizard.](../media/about.png)](../media/about.png#lightbox)

1. Once the verification completes, request a valid domain name and select **Save** to check availability. If you don't see an error, the domain is ready to be used.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the How you'll sign in page of the wizard with the domain name Save button highlighted.](../media/domain.png)](../media/domain.png#lightbox)

1. Set up a username and password and sign in.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the How you'll sign in page with the username, password, and confirm password fields filled.](../media/password.png)](../media/password.png#lightbox)

1. Your Microsoft 365 tenant has been successfully created along with the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license that includes a Power Apps license as well.

You have successfully set up your Dynamics 365 trial environment. In the next module, we'll show you how to obtain the various trial licenses that are required to fully run the Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services.
