In this exercise, you'll embed the **Loan Application** form from the Loan Tracker app so that your users can have access to more information within Collaboration Manager for Loans. All apps in Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services use the same data model, which allows you to mix and match the experiences for the various apps.

## Task 1: Replace a default form within Collaboration Manager

Before creating your customizations, you first need to create a solution to contain the changes. 

1. Go to [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true) and select **Solutions** in the left navigation.

1. Select **New solution** to create a new solution.

1. Provide information for the required fields and then select **Save**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the New solution dialog with the Display name, Name, Publisher, and Version fields filled in.](../media/solution.png)](../media/solution.png#lightbox)

1. Open the solution that you created.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Solutions list with the Loan Tracker in Collaboration Manager solution highlighted.](../media/solutions-list.png)](../media/solutions-list.png#lightbox)

1. Because you want to show the Loan Tracker form instead of the default Collaboration Manager form, update the app module so that it shows a different loan application form. Select **Add existing > App > Model-driven app** so that you can begin making those changes.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Power Apps with Add existing expanded and App expanded to show the Model-driven app option.](../media/app.png)](../media/app.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Collaboration Manager for Loans** and then select **Add** to bring the app into your solution.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Add existing model-driven apps dialog with Collaboration Manager for Loans selected.](../media/add-model-driven.png)](../media/add-model-driven.png#lightbox)

1. When the app shows in your solution, select it to open it in the classic app designer.

1. Select the **Form** card for the **Loan application** entity within the app designer.

1. In the **Properties** pane on the right, clear the **Information** checkbox and then select **Loan tracker information form** instead.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Power Apps showing the app designer for Collaboration Manager for Loans with the options updated.](../media/form.png)](../media/form.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Select **Publish**. If you played the app at this point within Microsoft Teams, the components from Loan Tracker will be present, but the collaborative features like tasks, meetings, and notes wouldn't be present.

## Task 2: Add Collaboration Toolkit experiences in the Loan Tracker form

Now, you will edit the **Loan tracker information form** so that it includes the **Tasks**, **Meetings**, and **Notes** tabs. 

1. Select the edit icon next to the **Loan tracker information form**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of Power Apps showing the app designer for collaboration manager for loans with the edit button highlighted.](../media/edit.png)](../media/edit.png#lightbox)

   The **Loan tracker information form** will open in the form designer.

1. In the form designer, drag a **1-column tab** layout component from the **Components** drawer and then drop it to the left of the **Activities** tab.

    > [![Screenshot of Power Apps > Form showing the Components panel with a 1-column tab layout component being dropped to the right of the Activities tab.](../media/1-column-tab.png)](../media/1-column-tab.png#lightbox)

1. After dragging in the tab, rename it to **Tasks** in the **Properties** pane.

1. Select **Expand first component to full tab** in the **Properties** pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Tasks tab properties with Label, Name, and Expand properties set.](../media/expand.png)](../media/expand.png#lightbox)

1. Select the section within your new tab so that you can select **Hide label** within the **Properties** pane.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Select **Publish**.

1. You can now open Collaboration Manager for Loans in the Teams environment. All tabs from Loan Tracker and the collaborative tabs from Collaboration Toolkit should now display.
