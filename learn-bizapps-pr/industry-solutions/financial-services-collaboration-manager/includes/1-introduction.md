Collaboration Manager for Loans is built with the Banking data model, Collaboration Toolkit, and a loan manager solution:

- Publishing this combination of three solution layers creates the base version of Collaboration Manager for Loans. You can release this published version and use it in demo environments and in environments that support discover-try-buy scenarios.

- Partner versions of Collaboration Manager for Loans use the three solutions, which form the base Collaboration Manager for Loans. However, their specific customization solution is also added to an environment. For example, a customer solution could contain any or all of the following built specifically for the customer:

  - Data model changes that augment and extend parts of the Banking data model to customer-specific requirements.

  - Forms and views changes to support the data layer changes.

  - More API extensions, actions, functions, and plugins to support specific customer requirements.

  - PCF Controls used to replace default experiences with those specific to requirements. For example, a custom address verification component might be used. It connects to an external service provider with specific address verification capabilities.

- A replacement business process flow that maps to the customer's loan process flow.

By using this framework, our customers, partners, and system of record providers can build their own vision of Collaboration Manager.

## Industry prioritized scenarios

Collaboration Manager for Loans focuses on both delivering a differentiated customer experience, and empowering employees by enabling automation, collaboration, and communication to help accelerate lending processes, minimize errors, and enhance the customer experience.
