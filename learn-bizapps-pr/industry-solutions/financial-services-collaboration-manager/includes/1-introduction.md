Collaboration Manager for Loans within Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services is built with the Banking data model, Collaboration Toolkit, and a loan manager solution:

- Publishing this combination of three solution layers creates the base version of Collaboration Manager for Loans. You can release this published version and use it in demo environments and in environments that support discover-try-buy scenarios.

- Partner versions of Collaboration Manager for Loans use the three solutions, which form the base of Collaboration Manager for Loans. However, their specific customization solution is also added to an environment. For example, a customer solution could contain any or all of the following entities that are built specifically for the customer:

  - Data model changes that augment and extend parts of the Banking data model to customer-specific requirements.

  - Changes to forms and views to support the data layer changes.

  - More API extensions, actions, functions, and plug-ins to support specific customer requirements.

  - Power Apps component framework controls that are used to replace default experiences with experiences that are specific to requirements. For example, you could use a custom address verification component, which connects to an external service provider with specific address verification capabilities.

- A replacement business process flow that maps to the customer's loan process flow.

By using this framework, your customers, partners, and system of record providers can build their own vision of Collaboration Manager.

## Industry prioritized scenarios
