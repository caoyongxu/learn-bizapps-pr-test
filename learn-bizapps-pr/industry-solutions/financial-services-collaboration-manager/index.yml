 title: Set up Collaboration Manager for Loans
 description: In this module, you'll learn how to set up Collaboration Manager for Loans within Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services. A model-driven app that is created with Microsoft Power Apps, Collaboration Manager for Loans is built specifically to work inside Microsoft Teams. It's built around the Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services retail banking data model that creates a set of common entities for financial services. Collaboration Manager enables collaboration around this data model by using components that are provided by a Collaboration Toolkit. These components, while enabling collaboration, separate the consumer from the details of interaction with other Microsoft services.
