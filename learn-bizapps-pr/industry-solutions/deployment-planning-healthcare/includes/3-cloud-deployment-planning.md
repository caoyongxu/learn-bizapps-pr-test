The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare applications are currently only supported on North American (NAM) Microsoft 365 tenants. [Other geographies will be supported in the future.]{.underline}

## Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 is a suite of cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools.. Along with various tools to address regular business administrator requirements, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare enhances Microsoft Teams to allow health care professionals to hold virtual patient visits while connecting with Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR).

Microsoft Bookings allow for online scheduling of virtual patient visits. Regular patient appointments can be booked if the organization does not have the capability in their EHR system.

## Subscription requirements

To utilize Microsoft Teamsnd the Microsoft 365 EHR integration to the Epic platform, the following Microsoft 365 subscriptions are required:

-   Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Premium, Enterprise (Microsoft Teams)

-   Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare Add-on (Microsoft 365 EHR integration)

-   Epic version November 2018 or later (Microsoft 365 EHR integration).
