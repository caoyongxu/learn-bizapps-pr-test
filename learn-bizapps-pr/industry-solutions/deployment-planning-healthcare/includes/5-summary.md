This module explained how to plan for a deployment of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare applications.

Additionally, it examined some of the features that are deployed to Microsoft Azure such as the Azure API for FHIR and the Azure Health Bot.

You learned about Microsoft Power Platform and how many of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare apps are built and extended by using Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 solutions. You also learned how to deploy some or all of these apps by using the Dynamics 365 Solution Center.

Finally, this module covered how Microsoft 365 is used, specifically to integrate Microsoft Teams with the EPIC EHR system. Organizations that are not using an EHR system can use Microsoft Bookings so that patients can schedule appointments with healthcare practitioners.
