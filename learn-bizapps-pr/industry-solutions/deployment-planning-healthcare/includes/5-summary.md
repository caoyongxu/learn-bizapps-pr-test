In this module, we learned how to plan for a deployment of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare applications.

We examined some of the features that are deployed to Microsoft Azure such as the Azure API for FHIR and the Azure Health Bot.

We learned about the Power Platform, and how many of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare apps are built and extended using the Power Platform and Dynamics 365 solutions. We learned how to deploy some or all of these apps using the Dynamics 365 Solution Center.

Finally, we covered how Microsoft 365 is used, specifically to integrate Microsoft Teams with the EPIC EHR system. For organizations not using an EHR system, the concept of using Microsoft Bookings was examined for patients to be able to schedule appointments with healthcare practitioners.
