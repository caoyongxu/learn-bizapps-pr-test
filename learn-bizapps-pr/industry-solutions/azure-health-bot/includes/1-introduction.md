The Azure Health Bot Service is a cloud platform that empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy their compliant, AI-powered virtual health assistants and health bots, that help them improve processes and reduce costs. It allows you to offer your users *intelligent* and *personalized access* to health-related information and interactions through a natural conversation experience.

With the service, healthcare organizations can build a "health bot instance" and integrate it with their systems that patients, nurses, doctors, and other representatives interact with. Building an instance allows you to:

- Improve processes

- Improve services

- Improve outcomes

- Reduces cost

The Health Bot Service contains a **built-in medical database**, including **triage protocols**. You can also extend a health bot instance to include your own scenarios and integrate with other IT systems and data sources. To learn more about Azure Health Bot, see [Azure Health Bot Overview](/azure/health-bot/?azure-portal=true) on Microsoft Docs.
