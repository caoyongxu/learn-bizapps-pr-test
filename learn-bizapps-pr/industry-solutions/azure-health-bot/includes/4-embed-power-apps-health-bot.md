In this exercise, you will be embedding the **Omnichannel Chat Widget** into the Power Apps Customer self-service portal using Portal Management configuration. In your environment, you created a Lamna Healthcare Company Portal using the **Customer self-service portal** template before deploying Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. Now we will configure the chat widget to show on the customer website.

**Customer self-service portal**: A customer self-service portal enables customers to access self-service knowledge, support resources, view the progress of their cases, and provide feedback.

**Portal Management**: Application to help you get started with the advanced portal configuration. In this walk-through, you will learn how to configure Chat widget in **Portal Management**Â app.
