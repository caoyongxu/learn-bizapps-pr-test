Volunteer Management is a model-driven Power App designed to manage engagement opportunities, together with the qualifications required, shifts, and number of volunteers needed. It enables you to manage the recruiting and onboarding process, and the relationship with volunteers throughout the lifecycle, with the following components:

**Volunteers:** Volunteers are a type of contact. A contact represents an individual volunteer, with their contact and personal details. Each volunteer can have qualifications, preferences, and participations linked to their profile.

**Groups:** Groups allow you to categorize volunteers together based on a certain characteristic. For example, a group could be created for volunteers from a particular organization (for example, corporate volunteering days), or those who share a common interest.

**Engagement Opportunities:** Engagement opportunities are the core record in Volunteer Management where volunteer managers can set up and manage all the information about the engagement, including a description, location, qualifications required, options for automated messaging to participants, and shifts for volunteer engagements.

**Participations:** Participations are used to record and track the lifecycle of the volunteer participation in an engagement opportunity, from application through to completion of the engagement.

**Qualifications:** Qualifications are used to record skills, certifications, and training held by volunteers. They can have a start and end date, a proficiency level, and a qualification type.

**Onboarding:** You can set up a template for each different onboarding process you have, with all the tasks, phone calls, and appointments that should be completed at each stage, who the activity is assigned to, and the due date.
