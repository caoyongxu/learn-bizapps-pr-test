Memberships in Fundraising and Engagement allow a constituent to participate in, or belong, to a specific group.

Membership groups allow you to group membership categories together. For example, a nonprofit organization may use memberships to track a constituent's V.I.P. level.

Membership categories can be considered the main membership record. Membership category represents the different types of memberships available within a membership group.

Membership orders connect membership categories to membership groups. This creates a list of membership options available to the user when processing a membership.

Membership instances are the full reference list of memberships by constituent. They are what associates a contact or organization record to a particular membership.
