[Microsoft Exchange Online](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/exchange/exchange-online/?azure-portal=true) isn't a bulk email service, and it has a limit of 10,000 emails each day for each mailbox, which won't suffice for typical email volumes that are required for vaccination management scenarios. Therefore, those scenarios require customers to have their own bulk email service, according to their choice and compliance needs, that they can use to send emails for various scenarios including registration confirmation, booking invitations, appointment confirmation and cancellations, appointment reminders, and maintaining immunization records. While the actual number of sent emails will vary for each deployment based on your registration and vaccination volumes, the number of emails can be *excessively high each day during peak times*.

Customer implementations can extend the [standard Power Automate flows](/dynamics365/industry/vaccination-management/configure-security-portal-flows/?azure-portal=true#configure-power-automate-flows) in Microsoft Vaccination Management to integrate Microsoft Vaccination Management with an external bulk email provider of their choice.

Popular bulk email services, such as [SendGrid](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/SendGrid.SendGrid?tab=Overview&azure-portal=true), have standard Power Automate connectors that customers can use, or they have other bulk email services that customers can integrate by building a Power Automate custom connector.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to extend an email flow to integrate with SendGrid as an example of sending higher volumes of emails.

## Task 1: Extend an email flow to integrate with bulk email service

In this task, you'll learn how to use the SendGrid connector as an example of sending higher volumes of emails.

1. (Optional) You can use the same steps from this task to replace the Office 365 Outlook connector with the SendGrid connector on the other email flows: **Send Email (Phase Opening)**, **Send Email with Attachment (Base)**, and **Send Email (Generic)**.

## Task 2: Test the Power Automate flow changes

In this task, you'll test the Power Automate flow changes that were done as part of this exercise by registering in the **Registration and booking portal** and then you will verify the email.

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. To test the email flow, select **Apps** on the left navigation bar and then you can view the list of apps that are deployed in the environment.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the navigation pane with Apps highlighted.](../media/5-19-apps.png)](../media/5-19-apps.png#lightbox)

1. Find and select the **Registration and booking portal** to open it on a new tab page in the browser. This portal is used for registering and booking appointments.

1. Select **Start registration** in the portal.

1. Don't set **Yes** for any of the questions in the questionnaire.

1. After filling in the questionnaire, provide all required resident details and then make sure that you provide a last name starting between the letters A-M.

1. At the end of the page, enter the year in the **Date of birth** field as **1990** and then provide a valid email address.

1. At the end of the review page, select the confirmation checkbox and then select the **Complete registration** button.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the confirmation checkbox and the Complete registration button.](../media/5-20-confirm.png)](../media/5-20-confirm.png#lightbox)

After one to three minutes, **Email Registration Confirmation (Lastname: A-M)** will pass the required details to its child flow, **Send Email(Registration)**, to send an email to the resident. Within three minutes, you'll also receive a registration confirmation email to the email address that you provided in the **Registration and booking portal**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the received confirmation email.](../media/5-21-confirmation.png)](../media/5-21-confirmation.png#lightbox)

1. If you haven't received the registration email by five minutes after submission, then follow these steps:

    1. Check for the email in your **Junk** folder.

    1. If you can't find the registration email in your **Junk** folder, then verify whether the steps in Exercise 1, Task 1, Steps 4 and 5 were followed and then redo this task.

    1. If you can't find the registration email even after following the preceding steps, then open the latest runs in the **Email Registration Confirmation (Lastname: A-M)** and **Send Email(Registration)** flow history to troubleshoot it further.

1. You can also verify the **28-day run history** for the run status and detailed run history in the **Email Registration Confirmation (Lastname: A-M)** and **Send Email(Registration)** flows.

1. If you're receiving the same email every three minutes, then it could stem from an incorrect setup of values in the flow.

    1. Turn off the **Send Email(Registration)** flow immediately and compare all values that are set in your **Send Email(Registration)** flow as part of Exercise 4, Task 1, Steps 15 and 16.

    1. If you don't see a difference, then open the latest run from the **Send Email(Registration)** flow history to troubleshoot it further.

    1. Don't turn on the flow again until you have found the difference in the setup and have corrected it.

Congratulations, you've learned how to integrate a bulk email service with Microsoft Vaccination Management email flows.
