Power Automate flows are used in Microsoft Vaccination Management to automate multiple business processes such as sending registration confirmation emails, appointment reminder emails, vaccine dose reminder emails, and creating bulk appointment slots.

In this exercise, you will play the role of a system administrator, where you will explore the included Microsoft Vaccination Management flows, enable the Power Automate flows, and customize the flows.

## Task 1: Update the environment variable

Some Power Automate flows handle the sending of emails. These emails are based on a defined template that is filled with dynamic data. In the emails, such as appointment booking/cancellations, the URL of the **Registration and booking portal** is often mentioned.

In this task, you'll change that URL in the **RegistrationPortalUrl** environment variable from the default to the one that is specific to your **Registration and booking portal**. This action will ensure that all automatically generated emails will have the correct URL to your portal without modifying the individual flows.

For more information, see [Environment Variables](/power-platform-release-plan/2019wave2/microsoft-powerapps/new-solution-components-get-full-support/?azure-portal=true).

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. Select **Apps** on the left navigation pane and then view the list of apps that are deployed in the environment.

## Task 2: Create new Power Automate connections

A connection is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Microsoft Azure Logic Apps. A connection provides a way for users to connect their accounts and use a set of prebuilt actions and triggers to build their apps and workflows.

In this task, you'll learn how to add the connections, such as **Office 365 Outlook** and **Microsoft Dataverse**, which will be used in later tasks to associate it with connection references.

For more information, see [Power Automate Connections](/power-automate/add-manage-connections/?azure-portal=true).

1. In the left navigation pane, expand **Data** and select **Connections**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the navigation pane with Connections highlighted.](../media/4-9-connections.png)](../media/4-9-connections.png#lightbox)

1. To add an **Office 365 Outlook** connection, select **+ New connection**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the New connection button.](../media/4-10-new.png)](../media/4-10-new.png#lightbox)

1. Search for **Office 365 Outlook** in the search bar, located in the upper-right corner, and then select the plus (**+**) button to add the connection.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Office 365 Outlook search.](../media/4-11-outlook.png)](../media/4-11-outlook.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Create** button on the dialog box.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Office 365 Outlook dialog box with the Create button highlighted.](../media/4-12-create.png)](../media/4-12-create.png#lightbox)

1. This connector will prompt for credentials. These account/connection details will be used by the **Office 365 Outlook** connector in the **MVM Power Automate** email-related flows to send emails. Therefore, this account will be considered the **From** email address in all outgoing emails that use this connector.

    Provide the **no-reply** email account credentials that were provided by your lab instructor.

1. To add a **Microsoft Dataverse** connection, select **+ New connection** again.

1. Search for **Microsoft Dataverse** in the search bar, located in the upper-right corner, and then select the plus (**+**) button to add the connection.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Dataverse search results.](../media/4-13-dataverse.png)](../media/4-13-dataverse.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Create** button on the dialog box.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Dataverse dialog box with the Create button highlighted.](../media/4-14-create.png)](../media/4-14-create.png#lightbox)

1. This connector will prompt for credentials. These account/connection details will be used by the **Microsoft Dataverse** connector in the **MVM Power Automate** flows to perform CRUD operations on this environment's database.

    For this task, you can use your **MVM In A Day** user account (credentials that you're using to sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true)) to establish the connection; however, in a customer's environment, make sure that you use a dedicated service account instead of a user's account.

## Task 3: Link connections to Microsoft Vaccination Management connection references

A connection reference is a solution component that contains information about a connector. The operations within a Power Automate flow bind to a connection reference. You can update the connection references that are used by Microsoft Vaccination Management to point to the connections that are created as part of the earlier task.

For more information, see [Connection references](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-connection-reference/?azure-portal=true) and [Connectors](/connectors/?azure-portal=true).

In this task, you will be using an unmanaged solution, **Vaccination Management Configuration**, and then you will update the connection on the connection references with the new connections that were created as part of the earlier task.

1. In the left pane, select **Solutions** and then view the list of solutions that are deployed in the environment.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the navigation pane with Solutions highlighted.](../media/4-15-solutions.png)](../media/4-15-solutions.png#lightbox)

1. On the **Solutions** page, select the **Vaccination Management Configuration** solution.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the solutions list with Vaccination Management Configuration highlighted.](../media/4-16-configuration.png)](../media/4-16-configuration.png#lightbox)

1. After opening the **Vaccination Management Configuration** solution, you can view the connection references that are used in the Microsoft Vaccination Management flow. This unmanaged solution allows you to link the connection references to the appropriate connections that were created as part of a previous task.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the list of flows with check marks indicating that all are turned on.](../media/4-24-turned-on.png)](../media/4-24-turned-on.png#lightbox)

## Task 5: Create a solution

In this task, you will learn how to create a solution to group all changes that you will make in the subsequent tasks and exercises. Solutions are used to transport apps and components from one environment to another or to apply customizations to existing apps. A solution can contain one or more apps and other components such as site maps, tables, processes, web resources, choices, flows, and more.

Solutions are the mechanisms for implementing application lifecycle management (ALM) in Power Apps and other Microsoft Power Platform products, such as Power Automate. For more information, see [Overview of ALM with Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/alm/overview-alm/?azure-portal=true).

For more information, see [Solutions](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/introduction-solutions/?azure-portal=true).

1. In the left pane, select **Solutions** and then view the list of solutions that are deployed in the environment.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the navigation pane with Solutions highlighted.](../media/4-15-solutions.png)](../media/4-15-solutions.png#lightbox)

1. On the **Solutions** page, select **New solution** in the command bar.

1. In the right pane, select the **Publisher** dropdown list and then select **+ Publisher** to create a new published record on a new tab page in your browser.

    The solution publisher indicates who developed the app. For this reason, you should create a solution publisher that is meaningful. For more information, see [Solution publisher](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm#solution-publisher/?azure-portal=true). After you have set up a publisher, it can be linked to every (new) solution that is created.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Publisher dropdown list with the + Publisher option highlighted.](../media/4-25-publisher.png)](../media/4-25-publisher.png#lightbox)

1. In the **New Publisher** form, enter the following required and optional information:

    - **Display Name** - Enter the display name for the publisher, for example, **MVM In A Day**.

    - **Name** - Enter the unique name for the publisher. This name is generated by using the value that you enter in the **Display Name** field. You can edit this field before you save the publisher record. For example, you can edit the **Name** field to **mvminaday**.

    - **Prefix** - Enter the publisher prefix that you want, such as **mvmiad**.

    - **Option Value Prefix** - This column generates a number based on the publisher prefix. This number is used when you add options to choices and it provides an indicator of which solution was used to add the option.

    - **Contact Details** - Optionally, you can add contact and address information.

1. Select **Save and Close** in the upper-left corner.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
