As you have seen in this module, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundraising and Engagement enables you to manage relationships with your constituents, and to manage the end-to-end fundraising process.

You can manage relationships with your donors, and maintain unique donor profiles, providing insights and the ability to personalize interactions. You can automate the processing of gifts, manage fundraising events, and manage major moves from solicitation through to donor commitment. Finally, you can track your fundraising milestones against campaigns and gain insight from built-in dashboards.
