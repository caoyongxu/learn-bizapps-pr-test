Fundraising and Engagement is a ready-made application for donor relationship and fundraising management. It uses the full capabilities of Dynamics 365 Sales together with capabilities and processes built specifically to enable the following nonprofit scenarios:

**Constituent Management:** Fundraising and Engagement enables nonprofits to maintain a unique profile for each individual donor, with their donation history, memberships, interests and preferences, and a timeline of activities and notes. You can view donors in relation to their household, and their relationship with an organization. You can also manage relationships with the organizations who donate to, partner, or work with you.

**Gift Processing:** Drive fundraising efficiency by automating gift processing and keeping a complete record of all gifts in one place. Fundraising and Engagement enables you to process all kinds of donations, including money, in kind, and soft credits. You can manage regular giving using automated processes, and record and manage commitments by donors who pledge to make a gift in future. The built-in dashboards give you the ability to drill down and analyze your fundraising and provide full visibility of major gifts received. You can automatically issue receipts and thank you notes to donors.

**Moves Management:** Maintaining unique donor profiles together with a complete donation history means prospect researchers and donor stewardship staff who research new and existing donors have all the information they need to identify prospects more likely to support their mission. Fundraising and Engagement enables you to use insights to identify these prospects and manage the stewardship process and activities with a guided process flow, pipeline reporting, and financial and reporting plans.

**Membership Management:** Track and manage your memberships using Fundraising and Engagement, either as part of the fundraising process, or to align your constituents with a membership group. You can manage payments, renewals, and different membership levels and categories.

**Campaign Management:** Fundraising and Engagement enables you to link every donation, event, and solicitation to a campaign, so that you can track and manage fundraising progress and milestones against your goals and apply the reporting and insights you need.

**Event Management:** Event managers can use Fundraising and Engagement to set up and manage the end-to-end process for fundraising events, including venues, sponsorships, donations, registrations, and ticketing. For gala events, you can manage table registrations and allocations, as well as dietary requirements and other preferences.
