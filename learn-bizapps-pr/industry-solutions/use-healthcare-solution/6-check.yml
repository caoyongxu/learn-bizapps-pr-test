  questions: 
  - content: The Home Health app in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is extended from which Dynamics 365 app?
    choices: 
    - content: Dynamics 365 Customer Service
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The Home Health app allows for resources, such as home healthcare professionals, to be scheduled for home visits, which uses the functionality of Dynamics 365 Field Service. Dynamics 365 Customer Service doesn't have the resource scheduling capability. Dynamics 365 Marketing is used for outreach (Patient Outreach), and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is used for Enterprise Resource Planning applications.

  - content: A patient's data is integrated from an electronic medical records (EMR) system and is updated by using the Care Management app. How can you provide the patient with access to view their medical information?
    choices: 
    - content: Use the FHIR Sync Agent to sync data to the Patient Access portal
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Patient data is stored in Microsoft Dataverse, so the patient will have immediate access to their information through the Patient Access portal (based on Power Apps portals). Patient data will also be visible in all Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare apps because the row is stored in Dataverse. You would use the FHIR Sync Agent to integrate data from an electronic medical records (EMR) system. Adding a patient to a Microsoft Teams channel won't give them access to their medical information.
    - content: Copy the patient data to the Patient Service Center app
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Patient data is stored in Microsoft Dataverse, so the patient will have immediate access to their information through the Patient Access portal (based on Power Apps portals).

  - content: A healthcare agent is communicating with a patient by using the Patient Service Center app. The agent needs to know the medications that the patient is taking. How can the agent find this information?
    choices: 
    - content: Sign in to the Patient Access portal and view the patient information.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The Patient Service Center app provides agents with the ability to view the patient form that shows medications on the timeline. The agent can’t sign in to the portal for the patient. The agent could get the same information from the Home Healthcare app and the EMR system, but it would be more efficient to get it directly from the agent dashboard.
    - content: Launch the Home Healthcare app and view Home Health work orders for this patient.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The Patient Service Center app provides agents with the ability to view the patient form that shows medications on the timeline.
