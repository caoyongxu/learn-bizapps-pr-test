In this exercise, you will create a healthcare-focused, virtual marketing event that corresponds to the patient journey that you created in the previous exercise, where you sent the Healthy Eye Seminar event invite to everyone in the patient segment. The **Marketing Event Management** feature helps you every step of the way, from initial planning and budgeting through promotion and publication, attendee registration, webinar broadcasting, final analytics, lead generation, and evaluation of ROI.
