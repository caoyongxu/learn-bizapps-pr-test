The **Patient Outreach** application allows healthcare providers to communicate with their communities and patients in a targeted, efficient way. Patient Outreach is a patient campaign management application that helps organize and automate marketing and outreach to patients.

Key capabilities of **Patient Outreach** include:

-   **Patient segmentation:** Prebuilt patient segments based on the industry standard Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) to provide baseline patient cohorts.

-   **Patient engagement campaigns:** Create healthcare-specific email campaigns that use patient segments based on the HEDIS industry standard.

-   **Event management:** Use provider/payor event management templates for event administration and registration.

At his annual check-up earlier this year, Andrew learned that he has hypermetropia, a common eye condition in adults in which nearby objects are blurry. Lamna Healthcare Company has seen a recent influx of patients who would like to be more educated on hypermetropia and has decided to increase their patient outreach efforts by hosting a virtual marketing event.

In this lab, you will play the role of a Lamna Healthcare Company marketing administrator and utilize Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare's Patient Outreach capabilities to create a virtual marketing event.
