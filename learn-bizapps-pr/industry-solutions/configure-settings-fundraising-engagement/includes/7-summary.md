As you have seen in this module, giving levels, preference categories, objectives, and budgets are settings that can be configured in Fundraising and Engagement for tracking and segmentation purposes.

Giving levels help you categorize and segment constituents based on the total donations received and are automatically applied to a contact or organization based on their total giving.

Tracking of preferences is key to providing a personalized experience, delivering tailored asks, and segmenting. Preferences allow you to store information such as personal interests and targeted communication interests for a constituent. They can also be used on either opportunities or events.

Objectives allow you to track how your nonprofit's activities link back to their strategic objectives--the bigger picture.

Budgets are where you can assign funds towards a particular objective of your organization.
