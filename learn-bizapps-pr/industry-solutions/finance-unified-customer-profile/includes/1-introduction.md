The **Unified customer profile** application shows a 360-degree perspective of the customer, consolidated into a unified dashboard. It offers an accurate, consistent, and cohesive source of truth about the customer. You can use this customer information to provide personalized experiences, reveal important opportunities, prevent potential loss or churn, and improve customer satisfaction.
