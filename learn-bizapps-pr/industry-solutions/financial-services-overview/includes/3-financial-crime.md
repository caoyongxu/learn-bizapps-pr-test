There are two major capabilities that fall under combatting financial crime, Account protection at the digital identity & account level and Purchase protection for Merchant transactions.

## Account protection

Account Protection provides protection at the digital identity account layer, helping to identify and prevent fraud at digital account creation. In effect, it prevents bad actors from creating digital accounts and at digital account sign-in.

-   This solution rolls together risk assessment and bot protection, so everything is in one place rather than point solutions.

-   Account protection is simple to integrate with existing systems, helping to reduce time and effort.

-   Finally, Account protection is built for compliance. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest and de-identified on its way into the network.

## Purchase protection

Purchase protection capabilities provide a differentiated experience for merchants to improve revenue and retention:

-   A hallmark of purchase protection is a balanced approach. The focus is not only on helping to reduce loss but also on decreasing false positives.

-   To achieve this, Purchase protection offers a Transaction Acceptance Booster, which helps authorize more legitimate transactions by streaming real-time risk data to merchant's card authorization engine.

-   Next, Purchase protection increases value for customers. This capability offers effective fraud protection as a service to Merchant's customers at scale, helping to increase profitability and customer satisfaction.
