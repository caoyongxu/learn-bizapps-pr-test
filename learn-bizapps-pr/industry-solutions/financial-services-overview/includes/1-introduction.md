The COVID-19 pandemic was a catalyst for change and for shifting business priorities in the financial services sector. In the forefront is the way that the pandemic has shifted the industry.

Currently, the disruption from the pandemic and multiple macroeconomic trends is driving financial industry players to ask for support with the following areas:

-   **Customer engagement** - Customers are using digital engagement channels more often. This rise in adoption of digital during the pandemic has driven financial services organizations to expedite their digital transformation agendas. In a recent Celent global research analysis, 75 percent of bank respondents have observed budgets grow for digital banking enhancements for self-service and assisted channels. Digital-forward financial services institutions are leading the way when it comes to investing in digital experiences for high-value offerings such as lending.

-   **Employee experience** - The pandemic swings have spurred the need to be flexible in adapting to changing work patterns. While financial services institutions have embraced digital tools for communication and collaboration, more is needed to help employees (especially employees who serve customers) become successful in their roles.

-   **Value creation** - Global interest rates that hover near zero will put pressure on profitability, with inflation as a concern. Banks, insurers, and other financial services organizations are looking for opportunities to unlock value creation for long-term benefits and to lead with differentiation.

-   **Fraud protection** - In 2020, there were 393,207 reports of credit card fraud in the US. Account and purchase fraud have affected consumers and adversely impacted the credibility and reputation of financial institutions. With fraud on the rise, many companies are looking for new approaches to fraud protection.

-   **Security and compliance** - The industry is experiencing a level of regulatory scrutiny that is unprecedented in its intensity. Financial institutions that best manage their regulatory and compliance data will be on a path toward stronger risk management and improved operational efficiency. 

As a result, banks are looking for a new approach to pave the way for the future. With these priorities in mind, banks are prioritizing cloud services to drive digital transformation because of the ability to speed up deployment, lower complexity, and manage upfront investment.

## Priority scenarios

In response to the industry's focus on cloud services, Microsoft has prioritized developing services that are specific to the industry. Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services is built on a foundation of privacy, security, and regulatory compliance across Microsoft and the partner ecosystem.
