Today, the disruption from Covid and multiple macro-economic trends is driving Financial industry players to support with the following:

-   **Customer engagement**: Customers are using digital engagement channels more than ever. This rise in adoption of digital during the pandemic has driven financial services organizations to expedite their digital transformation agendas. In a recent Celent global research, 75% of bank respondents have seen budgets grow for digital banking enhancements for self-service and assisted channels. Digital-forward financial services institutions are leading the way when it comes to investing in digital experiences for high-value offerings such as lending.

-   **Employee experience**: The pandemic swings have spurred the need to be flexible to adapt to changing work patterns. While financial services institutions have embraced digital tools for communications and collaboration, we hear there is more needed to help employees, especially those in the front office-serving customers, become successful in their roles.

-   **Value creation:** Global interest rates hovering near zero pressures profitability with inflation as a concern. Banks, insurers, and other financial services organizations are looking for opportunities to unlock value creation for long-term benefits and to lead with differentiation.

-   **Fraud protection**: In 2020, there were 393,207 reports of credit card fraud in the US. Account and purchase fraud not only affect consumers but also adversely impact the credibility and reputation of financial institutions. With fraud on the rise, many are looking for new approaches to fraud protection.

-   **Security and compliance:** The industry is experiencing a level of regulatory scrutiny that is unprecedented in its intensity. Financial institutions that best manage their regulatory and compliance data will be on a path to stronger risk management and improved operational efficiency. 

> As a result, banks are looking for a new approach to pave the way for the future. With these priorities in mind, banks are prioritizing cloud services to drive digital transformation because of the ability to speed up deployment, lower complexity, and manage upfront investment.
