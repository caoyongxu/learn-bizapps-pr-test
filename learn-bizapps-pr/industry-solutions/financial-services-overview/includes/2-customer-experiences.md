With a Unified customer profile, banks can take advantage of cross-sell/up-sell opportunities, helping to increase customer lifetime value and loyalty.

The core functional capabilities of Unified customer profile include:

-   **Customer insights** - Financial details such as life events and household information come together to help create a single customer view. This comprehensive view is accomplished with the help of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, a customer data platform that helps connect tools across your bank by using a wide range of connectors. It has the functionality to mix, match, and merge to help unify customer information across these tools. It also allows you to add AI models for data enrichment.

-   **Summary view** - This capability helps capture a single, unified, yet intuitive view of the customer's financial situation to quickly know customers and personalize their experiences.

-   **Banking segments** - By segmenting customers into groups that share similar values, financial standing, and so on, banks can use this capability to focus on the right customers and opportunities to increase success.

-   **Churn risk** - Adaptive AI helps banks comprehend the customer's likelihood to churn, which will help inform decisions and empower agents to take preemptive actions and reduce risk of churn.

## Customer onboarding
