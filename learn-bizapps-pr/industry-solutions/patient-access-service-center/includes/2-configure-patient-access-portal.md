In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Set up an external website to display the Healthcare Patient Portal template.

- Modify Healthcare Patient Portal to display the proper company name.

- Create a registration code and invite a patient to create an account for the website.

- Sign in as the patient to navigate the features of the healthcare portal.

**Healthcare Patient Portal** is a template that is installed in your environment by the Patient Access module in Microsoft Cloud Solution Center when Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare was deployed.

A *portal* is an external website that allows for communication between a company and its users. In this case, the Lamna Healthcare Company wants an external website for their patients to access their medical histories and communicate effectively with the institution. The Healthcare Patient Portal template tailors the website's user interface (UI) for a healthcare company, focusing on providing more secure communication, information access, and an overall improved patient experience.

The following image shows an example of the welcome page that displays after you have configured and signed in to the Healthcare Patient Portal.

For more information, see [Microsoft Power Apps portals documentation](/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/?azure-portal=true#).

### Task 1: Set up the Healthcare Patient Portal

Prior to deploying Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, you created a portal in your environment by using the **Customer Self-Service** template. Creating this portal was a prerequisite for deploying the Patient Access module.

Lamna Healthcare wants to associate the previously installed Customer Self-Service portal with the **Healthcare Patient Portal** template so that the correct website is displayed to the user. The following steps will guide you through the process of binding your website to the proper template and restarting the portal for changes to apply.

First, open the portal to view the Customer Self-Service template that is currently bound. After you have completed the configuration steps in this task, the new Healthcare Patient Portal user interface (UI) will display.

1. While using an In-Private or Incognito window, go to [http://make.powerapps.com](http://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. Select the correct environment from the **Environment** dropdown menu in the upper-right corner.
