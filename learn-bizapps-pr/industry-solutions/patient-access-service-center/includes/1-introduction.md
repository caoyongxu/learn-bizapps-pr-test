### Healthcare story

This lab will focus on the healthcare story of Casey Jensen.

Casey is an avid runner but has exercise-induced asthma and requires an albuterol inhaler to help her breathe while running. She's realized her current albuterol inhaler is low on medication and decides it's a good time to get a refill.

In this lab, you'll first play the role of a Lamna Healthcare system administrator to configure the Patient Access Portal and various tools in Patient Service Center. You'll also play the role of Casey, who will log into the portal, navigate the various options, interact with the Azure Health Bot, and escalate to a live agent in Patient Service Center to refill her medication.
