1. In the **Settings** area, select **Record Types**, which will allow you to set up the record types that you want to turn on for knowledge management. The grid might take a moment to load.

    - The list will include all entities that are available for a many-to-many (N:N) relationship.

    - Knowledge management is enabled for the Case table by default. Because this scenario will also use the Case table, you don't need to add more tables at this time.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Record Types for knowledge management, showing the Available list and Case and Contact shown in the Selected section.](../media/101-record-types.png)](../media/101-record-types.png#lightbox)

1. In **Settings**, the **Support portal connection** area allows you to integrate an external portal for publishing knowledge articles.

    - Selecting **Yes** will share the knowledge article as a link in the email that is sent to the customer.

    - Selecting **No** will share the article content that is inserted in the email body.

    Keep this selection as **No** because you won't be integrating an external portal connection.
