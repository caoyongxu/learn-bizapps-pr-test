The **Frontline worker** app is used by workers at vaccination sites to distribute and administer vaccinations safely and effectively. With the **Frontline worker** app, these critical workers have the information that they need to check in patients who have registered and booked an appointment, including the option to use touch-free QR code scanning. The app lets the vaccinator manage details of the vaccine, including the dose number and vaccine batch, and lets the vaccinator record post-vaccine reactions.
