The Frontline worker app is used by workers at vaccination sites to distribute and administer vaccinations safely and effectively. With the Frontline worker app, these critical workers have the information they need to check in patients who have registered and booked an appointment, with the option to use touch-free QR code scanning. The app lets the vaccinator manage the details of the vaccine, including the dose number and vaccine batch, and lets the vaccinator note post-vaccine reactions.
