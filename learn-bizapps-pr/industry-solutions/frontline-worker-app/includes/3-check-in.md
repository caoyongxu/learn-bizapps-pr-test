The Microsoft Vaccination Management Frontline worker app is a Power Apps canvas application designed for those who need to be on their feet. Microsoft Power Apps canvas applications are business applications that are built by dragging and dropping elements onto a canvas, just as you would design a slide in PowerPoint. You can then create Excel-like expressions for specifying logic and working with data. When ready, the app can be shared so that users can run it in a browser, a mobile device, or embedded in places like Microsoft Teams.

The Frontline worker app address several scenarios for vaccine site workers such as:

- Check in residents by scanning a QR code

- Check in residents by manually looking them up

- Administer and record vaccinations

In this exercise, you'll use two methods for checking in a resident: one by scanning a QR code, the other by manually looking them up in the Frontline worker app.
