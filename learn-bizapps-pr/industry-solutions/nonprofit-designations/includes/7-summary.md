In this module, we explored campaigns, appeals, packages, and designations in Fundraising and Engagement. Campaigns, appeals, packages, and designations are used across the system to plan, report on, and track the performance of fundraising.

Designations contain information needed to track expected and received revenue to the nonprofit organization's financial system.

Campaigns represent a reason why the nonprofit organization is raising funds. It's a container to track your plan, budget, activities, gifts, and results.

Appeals are the next level in the hierarchy, under a campaign. They represent the "how" for a campaign, that is, the method and approach used to raise funds for the campaign.

Packages are a level more specific than an appeal. It may be a particular email, donation page, or a printed piece, for example. Packages can be used for more granular reporting and analysis against an appeal.
