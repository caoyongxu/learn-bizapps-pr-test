### Patient outreach

Engage patients and their family members in patient care decisions and provide a personalized healthcare experience to help them stay engaged and current on their treatment. Patient outreach is a patient campaign management application that helps organize and automate marketing and outreach to patients. Healthcare providers can communicate with their communities and patients in a targeted, efficient way. Providers can use email, text, regular mail, or a combination, to provide healthcare information to specific groups of patients and community members.

Patient outreach enhances Dynamics 365 Marketing with healthcare-specific capabilities as part of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.
