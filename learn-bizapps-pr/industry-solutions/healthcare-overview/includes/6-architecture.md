## Core components

-   **Core healthcare systems**: These represent your existing health data sources and systems, including EHR, medical imaging, -omics, third-party data, IoMT, billing and finance, and CRM data.

-   **Security and Compliance**: Easily ingest and enrich any volume, variety, or velocity of healthcare data while gaining cloud computing capabilities and services from the world's most secure and compliant cloud.

-   **Industry Data model**: The Industry data model, comprised of comprehensive data tables and relationships, make it easier for healthcare organizations to quickly configure and deploy solutions using a common collection of entities.

-   **Microsoft Platform Layers**: The core healthcare capabilities are built on top of Microsoft's industry leading Cloud technologies including Microsoft Azure, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365. Use your data to power applications and business processes.

-   **Enhance Patient Experience**: This core healthcare capability is delivered using the following components:

    -   **Personalized Care**: Utilize Patient Access using a Power Apps portal. Allow care coordinators to chat with patients through the Patient Service Center using Dynamics 365 Omnichannel for Customer Service.

    -   **Patient Outreach**: Target outreach to healthcare patients using Dynamics 365 Marketing.

    -   **Virtual Health:** Integrate Microsoft Teams and a Dynamics 365 model-driven application created specifically for virtual care providers.

-   **Empower Care Team Collaboration**: This core healthcare capability is delivered using the following components:

    -   **Care Collaboration**: Utilize the Health Assistant with Dynamics 365 Microsoft Sales and Sales Insights Add-in.

    -   **Care Coordination**: Provide Home Health capabilities using the Dynamics 365 Field Service application and Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app. Care Management is a Dynamics 365 model-driven application, which has no prerequisite Dynamics 365 applications.

    -   **Continuous Patient Monitoring:** Utilize Azure Healthcare APIs to unify data from diverse streams such as clinical, imaging, device, and unstructured data using FHIR and DICOM services and Azure IoT Connector for FHIR.

-   **Improve Clinical and Operational Insights**: This capability focuses on utilizing Azure Healthcare APIs (preview) and the Healthcare data model for data interoperability, operational analytics, and clinical analytics.

-   **Platform Extensibility**: This capability is delivered by Independent Software Vendors and System Integrators by extending the Industry Data model and integrating their solutions with Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. Microsoft partners can build on and extend core cloud capabilities with healthcare-specific apps and platforms for payors, providers, biopharma, and MedTech organizations.

The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare provides unique capabilities designed to meet the healthcare's most pressing needs. With an end-to-end, highly configurable platform, you can take advantage of healthcare-specific capabilities including bots, portals for patients and care teams, templates, apps, AI models and intelligence, custom Power BI dashboards, pre-configured workflows, and more. The solution is also intended to help healthcare organizations meet industry-specific rules and regulations like HIPAA, HiTrust, and GDPR.

With our partners, Microsoft is reimagining healthcare with innovative tools and services on a highly configurable, end-to-end cloud platform specifically for the healthcare space. Enabling customers to deliver better care, experiences, and insights to improve global health outcomes.

By bringing this all together with the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, health organizations can enhance patient engagement, empower health team collaboration, and improve clinical and operational insights, all while protecting health information.
