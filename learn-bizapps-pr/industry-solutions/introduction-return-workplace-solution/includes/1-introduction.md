The Microsoft Power Apps Return to the Workplace solution offers the tools to help transition workforces back into the facility. It gives facility managers, or anyone who is responsible for the operational control of an organization's buildings and other facilities, the ability to maintain a safe, clean, and productive environment for the occupants.

The Return to the Workplace solution provides several features to help people plan, coordinate, and manage the safe return to the workplace. The solution contains modules for location readiness, location management, employee health and safety management, and workplace care management.

## Return to the Workplace features and benefits

The Return to the Workplace solution contains several different apps that target employees, visitors, and facility managers. Facility managers can track reopening phases, guest access, and more, which are all configurable based on any given facility location and their current localized rules for returning to work. Additionally, Return to the Workplace has dashboards to help determine the readiness of your organization, and it is a global application that is localized in 11 languages.

The Location Readiness dashboard helps determine the readiness of the facilities and helps to efficiently manage their safe reopening. Facility managers and task force leaders can use the Location Readiness dashboard to quickly make informed decisions by using critical factors like COVID-19 infection rates and availability of supplies. This dashboard can be accessed from the Facility Safety Management app or from Microsoft Power BI.

The Workplace Care Management model-driven app gives health and safety leaders the tools that they need to actively manage COVID-19 cases, identify hotspots for safety improvement, and import data from external systems to support case management and manual contact tracing. The Workplace Care Management dashboard allows you to monitor the workplace care management from the Workplace Care Management app.

The Employee Return to the Workplace *canvas app* offers your workforce the self-service tool that they need to feel confident about returning to the workplace and remain productive while onsite. They can use the canvas app to check in remotely and self-screen prior to entering a building.

The Return to the Workplace *portal app* allows external sources to follow a similar self-service process as the employee, where they can check in on invitation and self-screen before getting a pass. Users of the portal can add new guests or dependents, ensuring that the solution is decentralized and scalable. Like all portal apps, Return to the Workplace has a companion model-driven app for internal authenticated users to manage site content and user experience.
