## Prepare your physical locations

As conditions allow for you to plan the return, preparing the physical location can vary greatly depending on the conditions in various global and regional areas. The questions and activities here can get you started in the planning and help identify gaps in your planning. Some of these are as simple as creating a dashboard for you to monitor data, and others have other actions on that data such as ensuring you have appropriate personal protective equipment available as needed.
