## Prepare your physical locations

As conditions allow for you to plan the return to work, preparing the physical location can vary greatly depending on the conditions in various global and regional areas. The following questions and activities can get you started and help identify gaps in the planning. Some activities are as simple as creating a dashboard to monitor data, while other actions suggest additional actions on that data such as ensuring that you have appropriate personal protective equipment available as needed.

Preparation is key to setting up you and your organization for success. Having the right tools (both physical and technical) in place, will ensure that you can document and prepare to implement the plan in a way that is visible to all parties who need to be kept informed, regardless of their geographic location. Using Microsoft cloud solutions ensures that you can lead a safe return to the workplace, no matter where you and your team are physically located. Stay up to date with your tasks by using a single, synchronized list across Microsoft Outlook and mobile, regardless of your allocation with Microsoft To Do.

## Manage and operate open locations

As your locations reopen for business, your concerns will shift to other tasks such as disinfecting areas, controlling entry, and supporting hybrid teams of remote and onsite workers. The following questions can help guide you toward solutions for your particular needs in opening your business. After you have identified those needs, you will begin to explore what the Microsoft Internet of Things (IoT) solutions might offer to help your team.

## Support employee health and safety

A computer or individuals alone can't keep your employees safe in their return to the workplace. It is the responsibility of your employees to do the right thing. As an employer, you can provide them with the right tools to make this transition as easy as possible. Timely and informative interactions will help to ensure safety and improve employee sentiment. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing serves as an excellent tool for automated, personalized communications across email, SMS, social media, and beyond.
