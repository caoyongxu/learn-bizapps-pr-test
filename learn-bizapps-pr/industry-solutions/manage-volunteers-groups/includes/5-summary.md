In this module, you've explored how you can track and manage details of volunteers that your organization engages with. The volunteer record provides you a complete picture and history of your volunteers, including their personal details, timeline of activities, participation history, qualifications, preferences, and availability. Groups allow you to categorize volunteers together based on a certain characteristic such as a common interest.
