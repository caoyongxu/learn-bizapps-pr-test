In this module, you'll learn how to add volunteers to your database and associate them with groups. You'll learn how to keep track of all your volunteers, their contact and personal details, applications, qualifications, preferences, and participations. You'll also learn how to create groups of volunteers to link and associate volunteers with common interests, roles, or affiliations, or to manage communication to groups of volunteers together.
