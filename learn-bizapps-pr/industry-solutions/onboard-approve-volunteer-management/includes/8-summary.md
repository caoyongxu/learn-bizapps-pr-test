In this module you've seen how to manage incoming applications for volunteer engagement opportunities, including how to approve volunteers' applications, take them through an onboarding process, assign them to a shift, and communicate with them throughout the process.

Applications for engagement opportunities are managed using the participation record. Approved participants can be added to shifts and have their attendance outcome recorded. An engagement can be closed once it has been completed.

Onboarding allows you to track stages and steps, such as tasks, phone calls, and appointments that are involved with a volunteer successfully obtaining a certain qualification.
