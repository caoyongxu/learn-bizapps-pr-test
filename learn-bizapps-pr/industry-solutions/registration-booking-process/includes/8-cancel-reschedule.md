In this exercise, you will assume the persona of a public user who has registered and booked an appointment for vaccination through the portal. However, now you want to reschedule the appointment slot for vaccination. This exercise can be done only after you have completed Exercise 3 and the eligibility appointment email has triggered so that you can start the cancellation and rescheduling experience from the link that is embedded in the email.

## Task 1: Go to the portal and book an appointment
In this task, you will go to the portal and book an appointment.

1. At the end of Exercise 3, you should receive a confirmation email with an appointment confirmation QR code and a cancellation link. To launch the cancel and reschedule experience, select the **Reschedule or cancel my appointment** link in the email

	> [![Screenshot of the Reschedule or cancel my appointment link.](../media/reschedule-cancel.png)](../media/reschedule-cancel.png#lightbox)

1. The portal should launch on your browser. Enter the same date of birth that you previously entered during registration.

	> [!NOTE]
	> It is important that you enter the exact date because the system validates you against this data.

1. After the appointment details have loaded, select **Cancel and reschedule**.
