In this exercise, you will assume the persona of a public user who has registered and booked an appointment for vaccination via the portal but now wants to reschedule the appointment slot for vaccination. This exercise can be done only after you have completed Exercise 3 and the eligibility appointment mail has triggered so that you can kickoff the cancellation and rescheduling experience from the link embedded in the mail.

## Task 1: Navigate to portal and book an appointment

1.  At the end of exercise 3, you should receive a confirmation email with an appointment confirmation QR code and a cancellation link. To launch the cancel and reschedule experience, click on **Cancel and reschedule** link in the mail
