Microsoft helps make it easier for partners and customers to create new use cases and workflows without redefining the healthcare data architecture. The FHIR-based model makes Dynamics 365 implementations for healthcare customers simpler, quicker, and more secure. For more information, see [FHIR Specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html/?azure-portal=true).

[The healthcare data model](/dynamics365/industry/healthcare/overview-data-model/?azure-portal=true) is already included in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solutions. It's also available as a standalone option for partners and Dataverse customers in the Microsoft Cloud Solution Center. For more information, see [Deploy the healthcare data model (optional)](/dynamics365/industry/healthcare/deploy-data-model/?azure-portal=true).
