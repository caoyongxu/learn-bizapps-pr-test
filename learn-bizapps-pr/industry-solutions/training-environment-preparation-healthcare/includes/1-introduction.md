The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solution is composed of various integrated Microsoft technologies (Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Azure) that are tailored specifically for healthcare organizations. For more information about how to use and set up the various components in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, see [Set up and configure Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare](/industry/healthcare/configure-cloud-for-healthcare/?azure-portal=true).

The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare has specific product requirements to light up each scenario and feature. These Dynamics, Azure, and Microsoft 365 prerequisites are outlined in the table below, some of which are optional and will not be included in this learning path.
