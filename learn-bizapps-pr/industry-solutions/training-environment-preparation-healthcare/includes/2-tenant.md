To deploy Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare in a Microsoft Dataverse environment, you need to add a tenant and the prerequisite licenses. 

In this exercise, you will learn how to create a demo tenant. You can skip this exercise if you have already created a demo tenant and added the trial licenses.

## Create a Microsoft 365 tenant 

In this task, you will learn how to create a trial tenant along with the required Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 trial licenses. You can skip this task if you already have a tenant.

"Looks like you're already using \[email\] with another Microsoft service. Sign in to use this account with this trial, or create a new account." Select \"**Create a new account instead**\".

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the warning stating that the email address is already in use.](../media/warning.png)](../media/warning.png#lightbox) 

1.  After selecting **Create a new account instead**, it will ask for more details. Provide the necessary information. Enter a valid phone number where you can receive text message to validate the sign-up process.
