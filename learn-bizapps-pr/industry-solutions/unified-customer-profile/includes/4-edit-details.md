In this exercise, you will add and edit records and then observe how those changes reflect in Unified customer profile. Most of the information in Unified customer profile comes from financial core systems; hence, it's not editable. However, a few edit scenarios are supported and those scenarios are covered in this exercise.

## Task 1: Add, edit, and delete a life event

In this task, you will create a new life event, edit its details, and then delete it.

1.  In the Unified customer profile view that you have been working with, locate the **Life events** control. Select **Add new event**.
