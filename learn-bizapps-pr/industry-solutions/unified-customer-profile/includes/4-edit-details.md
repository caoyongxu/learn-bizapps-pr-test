In this exercise, you will be adding and editing records and see those changes reflect in UCP. Most of the information in UCP comes in from financial core systems and hence is not editable. But a few edit scenarios are supported and those will be covered here.

## Task 1: Add, edit, delete a Life event

In this task, we will create a new life event, edit its details, and then delete it.

1.  In the UCP view we have been working with, locate the Life events control. Select **Add new event**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the add new event button.](../media/add-new-event.png)](../media/add-new-event.png#lightbox)

1.  In the dialog box that opens, set the following properties and Select **Add new event** button.

	- **Select category and type:** Residence, Purchase
	
	- **Event date:** Enter any future date 
	
	- **Add additional information:** Bought a new house

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the residence details with add new event button.](../media/residence-event.png)](../media/residence-event.png#lightbox)

1.  The add event reflects in the **Residence** Life event control.
