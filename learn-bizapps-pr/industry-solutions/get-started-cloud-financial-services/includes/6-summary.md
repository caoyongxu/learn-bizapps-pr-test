Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services offers a comprehensive set of solutions for the financial services market. Bringing together capabilities from Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services expedites a financial services organization's ability to roll out solutions. In this module, we looked at how the unified customer profile provides a 360 view of the customer including data across business lines. We also looked at customer onboarding from loan application to tracking progress. Using simple configuration, the processes and required items can be tailored to individual organization needs.
