In this exercise, you will configure the schedule board for the bookable resource that you created in the previous task. The schedule board provides an overview of resource and booking availability. Before you use the schedule board, you need to set up the views and filters to your preference. To use the schedule board booking functionality, geocoding, and location services, you need to turn on the **Maps** feature.

The following screenshot shows an example of a configured schedule board.

1.  Now we will associate the Thomson Household home care work order with the Spanish fluency characteristic, so they match Monica with someone who is fluent in Spanish.  We have already applied this characteristic to her practitioner. We also want to set the estimated duration for the home visit.

	Select **Home Care** on the left sitemap and open the Home Care Work Order record number 00034 associated with the **Thomson Household**.
