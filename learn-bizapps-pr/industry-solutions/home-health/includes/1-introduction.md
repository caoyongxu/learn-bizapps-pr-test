The Home Health application in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare allows provider personnel to schedule appointments for the patient based on various factors. It allows you to communicate accurate information, at the correct time, to the appropriate people, to provide safe and effective care to your patients. With the Home Health app, you can manage home visit schedules, notify patients, and give access to medical information to the provider.

Key capabilities of the Home Health app include:

-   **Schedule home visit** - Enable care coordinators to schedule home visit appointments while viewing patient information directly in context.

-   **Provider scheduling** - View schedules of care team members and optimize visiting routes.

-   **Patient engagement** - Notify patients about upcoming appointments, follow up with patients after a visit, and automatically check with patients between visits.

-   **Home visit coordination** - Coordinate care and support distinct processes and tasks for the home visit.
