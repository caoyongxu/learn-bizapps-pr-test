In this module you have seen how qualifications, onboarding templates, and preferences are configured in Volunteer Engagement.

Qualifications are used in Volunteer Management to record skills, certifications, and training held by volunteers. They allow volunteers to find the opportunities that they are suitable for.

Qualifications are also used for setting up onboarding templates. Onboarding templates can be configured and allow you to define the stages and steps necessary in onboarding new volunteers, while ensuring consistency and visibility across the process.

Preferences can be recorded against volunteer engagement opportunities and volunteers to indicate areas of interest or preference.Â They assist in finding and matching the right volunteers for an engagement.
