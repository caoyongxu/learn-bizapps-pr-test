Onboarding is a special type of qualification in Volunteer Management. Onboarding templates can be configured and allow you to define the stages and steps necessary in onboarding new volunteers, while ensuring consistency and visibility across the process.

Onboarding templates can be set up when creating a qualification in the Configuration area of Volunteer Management. On the qualification type form, **onboarding** should be specified as the type. This will prompt you to create the onboarding process.

In the Onboarding Stages and Steps section, **+New Stage** will allow you to create the stages in the process.

Here, you can provide a name for the stage, sequence number of the stage, description, and relative due date.

This will create an onboarding process stage record. Within the record, you can specify the activities, or steps, that need to be completed. You can provide a name for the step, a description, and relative due date. Activity type can be either a task, phone call, or appointment.
