Engagement opportunities are the core record in Volunteer Management where volunteer managers can set up and manage information, requirements, and shifts for volunteer engagements. An engagement opportunity can be used for a single event or requirement, or for an ongoing engagement, which spans multiple days or shifts. You can manage applications directly in Volunteer Management and use the connected Volunteer Engagement portal to publish your engagements and receive applications directly into the app from volunteers online.
