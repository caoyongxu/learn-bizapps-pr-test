In this module, you have explored how engagement opportunities are created in Volunteer Management. Engagement opportunities are the core record in Volunteer Management where volunteer managers can set up and manage information, requirements, and shifts related to engagement opportunities. Engagement opportunities can be published privately or to the web. If published to the web, the engagement opportunity will be visible on the Volunteer Engagement portal where volunteers can sign up to participate.
