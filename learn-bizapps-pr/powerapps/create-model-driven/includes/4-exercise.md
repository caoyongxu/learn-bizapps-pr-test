Previously, you learned that by using the related action, you can view the accidents that an employee has been involved in. In this section, youâ€™ll learn how to modify that view to add more details about the accident. As a result, users can view the accident details without having to select each accident individually.

> [![Screenshot of the AccidentTable Associated View.](../media/associated.png)](../media/associated.png#lightbox)

The preceding image shows that the name of the view is **AccidentTable Associated View**. You need to modify the view to add more details about the accident. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Tables** in Microsoft Dataverse.

1. Find the **AccidentTable** in the list of tables.

1. Select **Views** and then find **AccidentTable Associate View**.

1. Select the **AccidentTable Associate View** to open it the designer studio.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Views tab on the AccidentTable.](../media/views.png)](../media/views.png#lightbox)

1. In the designer studio, select the following fields to add more detail to the view:

    - **AccidentDescription**

    - **ManagerComments**

    - **ManagerReviewed**

1. From the **Related** section, add the following fields:

    - **LocationName**

    - **AccidentName**

    - **AccidentSeverity**

1. Select **Publish** to save and finish the process.

1. Select **Back** to return to Dataverse.

1. Select **Apps**, and then find and select **Accident Tracking Application**.

1. Go to **EmployeeTables** and then select the **Rita Book** record.

1. Select **Related** and then select **AccidentTables**.

    The view that you updated should be visible, along with the fields.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of AccidentTable Associated View showing the added fields.](../media/fields-added.png)](../media/fields-added.png#lightbox)

This exercise demonstrates that, after you update the view, the results will be shown in your model-driven app. Changes in table views and forms automatically reflect in model-driven apps.
