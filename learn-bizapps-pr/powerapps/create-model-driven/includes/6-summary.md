In this module, you learned about the process of creating a model-driven app in Power Apps. The process of creating a model-driven app can be simple and quick, as shown in this module's exercises. However, as you create your own solutions, keep in mind that the difficulty and time to design a more complex app might increase depending on your business needs. The success of your app is directly related to how your tables are set up, the data model (relationships between the tables), and the way that your table views and forms are set up. Mapping out your business scenario and designing a sound data model will yield great dividends when you begin to design your model-driven app.

The app is ready to be used, but you still have one more module to explore before you've successfully completed this learning path. In the final module, you'll learn about business process flows and how Microsoft Power Automate can help you build a more complete solution by taking advantage of automating your everyday processes.
