In this module, we've gone over the process of creating a model-driven app. The process of creating a model-driven app can be simple and fast. Now obviously our scenario was fairly straight-forward, so keep that in mind. As you go on to create your own solutions, depending on your business needs, the difficulty and time to spin up a more complex app will increase. The success of your app is directly related to how your tables are set up, the data model (relationships between the tables), and finally, the way your table views and forms are configured. Taking the time upfront to map out your business scenario, and designing a sound data model will yield great dividends once you begin putting together your model-driven app.

The app is ready to be used, but we still have one more module to go before you've successfully completed this learning path. Just hang in there, only one more module to go and you don't want to miss out! In the final module, you'll learn about **Business Process Flows** and how **Power Automate** can help you build a more complete solution by taking advantage of automating some of your everyday processes.
