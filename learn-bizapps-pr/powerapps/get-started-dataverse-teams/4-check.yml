  questions: 
  - content: What is required to create a table in Dataverse for Teams?
    choices: 
    - content: A Table cannot be created until you have a Dataverse for Teams license.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Dataverse for Teams does not have a separate license from Teams.  If you are licensed for Teams, you have Dataverse for Teams.
    - content: A Table cannot be created until the Dataverse for Teams environment is provisioned when creating a new app or chatbot.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The Dataverse for Teams environment is only provisioned when the first Power App or chatbot is created.
    - content: A Table cannot be created until a Power App tab is added to a channel.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Creating a Power App tab in a Teams Channel doesn’t provision the Dataverse for Teams environment, which is needed to create the table.
    - content: A Table cannot be created until a Power Automate Cloud Flow has been associated with a Power App.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Flows do not provision the Dataverse for Teams environment, which is required to create a table.
  - content: Guest users who have access to our Team need the ability to create, modify, and delete records within our Table, but they should not be able to see records created by other users because they are not members of our company. Which level of privilege should they be assigned in the Management interface? 
    choices: 
    - content: Full Access
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Full access for guest users would give them create, modify, and delete permissions to any record.
    - content: Collaborative
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Collaborative access allows users to create new records and view any records created by other users.
    - content: Reference
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Reference doesn’t allow the user to create records but allows them access to any record created by other users.
    - content: Private
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Private will allow the guests to create records and then restrict them to only viewing those records that they created. They will not be able to view records created by other users.
    - content: None
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The None access denies them all access to the table.  They will be unable to create or view any records.
