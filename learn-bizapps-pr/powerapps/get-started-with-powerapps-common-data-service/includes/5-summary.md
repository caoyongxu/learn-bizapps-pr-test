Congratulations on using Microsoft Dataverse, and creating your first entity! 

Dataverse lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. Standard and custom entities within Dataverse provide a secure and cloud-based storage option for your data.

Let's review what you've learned:
- Dataverse stores data in entities. 
- If you can, it's preferable to use as many default entities as possible, so that your system is easy to maintain.
- Creating new entities is easy.
- The best way to get data into an entity is to export a template, add data, and upload it.
