Congratulations on learning to use Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps and creating your first entity!

CDS for Apps lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. Standard and custom entities in CDS for Apps provide a secure, cloud-based storage option for your data.

Let's review what you've learned:

- CDS for Apps stores data in entities.
- We recommend that you use as many default entities as possible, so that your system is easier to maintain.
- It's easy to create new entities.
- The best way to get data into an entity is to create a template and upload it.
