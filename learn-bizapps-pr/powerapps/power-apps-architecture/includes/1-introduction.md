The Solution Architect is responsible for the overall design of the solution. Understanding the capabilities of Power Apps is imperative when designing the apps for the solution. This module is concerned with the different types of apps, the differences between apps, and when and which type(s) of apps to use. Also how you divide up apps and how many apps you need.

This module provides technical details around Power Apps but does not try to discuss best practice as best practice is changing every few months in the Power Platform. A solution architect should always check the latest information for Power Apps.

The main objective of this module is to ensure a solution architect understands how to decide which app type to use.

## The types of Power Apps

There are three types of Power Apps:

- **Canvas** - Canvas apps are made up of screens, forms, and controls. You have full control over all the visual elements of your app via the Properties pane shown in the preceding screenshot. There, you can set values and properties, control navigation, and save data using Excel-like functions and expressions.
- **Model-driven** - Model-driven apps are apps built upon the data model you create in Dataverse. Model-driven apps are constructed from separate components, such as forms, views, charts, and dashboards. Each component type has its own editor and to build an app, you assemble the separate components.
- **Portal apps** - Portal apps are customer-facing websites built on top of Dataverse. With a portal app, you can expose your data to external stakeholders and allow them to view and update data securely.
