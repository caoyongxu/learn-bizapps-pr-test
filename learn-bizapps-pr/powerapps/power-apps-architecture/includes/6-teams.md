Microsoft Teams is becoming a key collaboration app that is the focus of a user's daily work. To prevent the need for users to switch between applications when accessing their data, it is possible to embed existing Power Apps in Microsoft Team channels.

There is a Power Apps app in Microsoft Teams, that once added enables Canvas apps to be created with a Team. This creates an environment and Dataverse for Teams database. The make can create an app within a team that all members of the team can access.

## Creating Power Apps in Microsoft Teams

Dataverse for Teams is a built-in, low-code data platform for Teams. The Power Apps app in Teams provides an integrated experience for app makers to create and edit apps  within Teams, and quickly publish and share them for anyone on the team to use, without having to switch between multiple apps and services. With Power Apps Studio embedded in the Power Apps app in Teams and the built-in data platform providing an easy-to-use, editable data table, you can quickly build apps based on custom data tables that are Teams-specific and scenario-specific.

Dataverse for Teams, built on Microsoft Dataverse, provides relational data storage, rich data types, enterprise-grade governance, and one-click solution deployment to the Teams app store. This version of Dataverse does not include all the functionality of Dataverse.

The advantage of creating Canvas apps inside of Teams is that no other license is required to use the app and data. If you have access to Microsoft Teams through a Microsoft 365 license, then you can use this feature.

Using Dataverse for Teams may look attractive as first sight, but as a solution architect you need to be aware of the limitations, particularly around integration, such as:

- No API access
- Some controls are not supported
- Canvas apps only
- AI Builder is not supported
- Custom connectors are not supported
