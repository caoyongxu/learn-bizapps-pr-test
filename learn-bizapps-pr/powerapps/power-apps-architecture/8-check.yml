  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Which component of Power Platform can developers create with TypeScript for enhanced visualization of data?
    choices: 
    - content: Component libraries
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Component libraries can only contain canvas app components that are built with the controls that are available to canvas apps. They can't use TypeScript.
    - content: Power Apps component framework
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Developers can create code components by using the Power Apps component framework with HTML and Typescript. These components can be used in canvas and model-driven apps to help you visualize data.
    - content: Web Forms
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Web Forms are used in portal apps only and are used to display data from Dataverse.
    - content: Application Insights
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Application Insights is an Azure service that allows telemetry on how your app is being used. 
  - content: Which tool should you use to perform regression testing of canvas apps?
    choices: 
    - content: Application Insights
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Application Insights is an Azure service that allows telemetry on how your app is being used. It is not used for testing.
    - content: Monitor
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Monitor allows a maker to see the events that are triggered with an app. It is not used for testing.
    - content: Easy Repro
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Easy Repro is a regression tool for testing model-driven apps, not canvas apps.
    - content: Test Studio
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Test Studio is a tool for testing, including performing regression testing on canvas apps.
  - content: Your canvas apps are performing poorly with many formulas to calculate a value. You want to offload processing to speed up performance. What should you do?
    choices: 
    - content: Create a Power Automate flow and then run the flow by using an expression.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A common method is to offload logic into a Power Automate cloud flow that uses the Power Apps trigger.
    - content: Create a Business process flow.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Business process flows are used in model-driven apps, not canvas apps.
    - content: Use the Concurrent function.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Concurrent function is used to run processing in parallel; it does not offload processing to another tool.
    - content: Move the logic into a Component library.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Moving the formulas into a canvas component will not speed up the processing or offload the work. The formula processing will still be performed by the canvas app.
