Thisâ€¯module explored how you can use Microsoft Dataverse relationships in canvas apps from Power Apps. As the real-life objects are related to each other, the relationships are used in Dataverse to link rows from one table to another. Additionally, relationships can provide constraints and behaviors that apply when actions are performed on the rows. You learned how Dataverse tables and relationships can work together to tell the story of your data. Additionally, by using the relationships properly, you can ensure that apps hide unnecessary complexities of the data model. To help accomplish that task, Power Fx language provides user-friendly notation for you to reference related data and to efficiently navigate the tables by using the relationships.
