In thisâ€¯module, we explored how you can use Microsoft Dataverse relationships in Power Apps canvas apps. As the real-life objects are related to each other, the relationships are used in Dataverse to link rows in one table to another. Relationships also can provide constraints and behaviors that apply when actions are performed on the rows. We walked through how Dataverse tables and relationships together tell the story of your data. By using the relationships properly, apps can hide unnecessary complexity of the data model. To help accomplish that, Power Fx language provides easy-to-use notation to reference related data and to efficiently navigate the tables using the relationships.
