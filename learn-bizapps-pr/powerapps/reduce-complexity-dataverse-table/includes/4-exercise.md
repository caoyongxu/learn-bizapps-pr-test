Contoso, like many companies, has multiple locations and allows employees to work from home. Occasionally, these employees need to come into the office and need a desk to use during their visit. Previously, Contoso instructed their employees to walk around the office location on arrival to find an available desk. The company has since discovered that this type of shared workspace system, or *hot desking*, has created challenges for IT support and licensing. As a result, Contoso has recently built a Microsoft Power Platform solution that will allow employees to view which desks are available and reserve one in advance.

In this exercise, you will be enhancing the canvas app from Power Apps.

In this task, you will add a favorite desk and add a label to show desk features.

1.  Expand **FindDeskScreen** and then select **GalleryDesks**.

1.  Select the **Edit** gallery icon.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the button for editing the gallery.](../media/gallery-edit.png)](../media/gallery-edit.png#lightbox)

1.  Go to the **Insert** tab, select **Icons**, and then select one of the icons. You will set the specific icon in the next step by using a formula. Therefore, for this step, it doesn't matter which icon you choose.

1.  Select the icon that you added and change the **Icon** value to the following formula. This formula will show the **thumbs up** icon filled if the user didn't indicate this desk as a favorite, or it will show the **thumbs up** icon if the user has already selected the desk as a favorite. 

> [!NOTE]
> The CountIf() function does encounter [delegation](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/delegation-overview/?azure-portal=true) challenges. If you have numerous rows in your app, you might need to use an alternate approach.

	`If(CountIf(ThisItem.Users, ThisRecord.User = currentUser.User) > 0, Icon.ThumbsUp,Icon.ThumbsUpFilled)`

1.  Make sure that you still have the icon selected. Select **OnSelect** and then paste the following formula. This formula will relate or unrelate this desk and signed-in user, depending on whether the user has already added the desk as a favorite.

	`If(CountIf(ThisItem.Users, ThisRecord.User = currentUser.User) > 0, Unrelate(ThisItem.Users, currentUser), Relate(ThisItem.Users, currentUser))`

1.  Reposition the icon in the gallery, as shown in the following image.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the icon position.](../media/icon-position.png)](../media/icon-position.png#lightbox)

1.  Make sure you are still in gallery edit mode. Go to the **Insert** tab and select **Label**.

1.  Select the label that you added and set the **Text** value to the following formula. This formula will concatenate the desk feature names and uses the many-to-many relationship between the Desk and Desk Features tables.

	`Concat(ThisItem.'Desk Features', Name, " , " )`

1.  Resize and reposition the label to better fit the space.

1. Select **File > Save**.

1. Select the **back** button.

1. Select **Play** to preview the app.

1. The gallery should appear like the following image. Select the **thumbs up** icon of one of the desks.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the thumbs up desk icon.](../media/like-icon.png)](../media/like-icon.png#lightbox)

1. The icon should change to thumbs up. Select the icon again.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> [![Screenshot of the thumbs up desk icon changed.](../media/like-icon-2.png)](../media/like-icon-2.png#lightbox)
