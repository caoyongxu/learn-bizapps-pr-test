By default, all full Dataverse environments have a set of standard tables that can be used to build business applications. It is best practice to try to use those existing tables to build solutions. For example, data about customers can be stored in the existing accounts or contacts tables. Although there are many tables, sometimes your app requires the creation of custom tables to store the data. In our scenario this is the case, as none of the existing tables have the meta data to support our app. In this unit, we will learn how to create custom tables in Microsoft Dataverse. We will create the following tables:

### EmployeeTable

This table will be used to track the details about employees of our company. For simplicity in our scenario, we will be creating only the following fields or attributes to track the employees:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of Employee Table columns.](../media/1-employee-table.png)](../media/1-employee-table.png#lightbox)

- **EmployeeId -** This will be a number autogenerated column to identify the employee number. It is common to identify employees using a number ID because it is easier to find or filter by a number rather than text. In this case having a number ID also helps identify employees who in some cases have the same name (last and first name).

- **EmployeeName -** In this case we will use one column to store the employee's full name. Most databases will use separate columns to store, first, middle, and last name. For the simplicity of this scenario, we will stick to just one column.

- **EmployeeDOB -** This will be a date only column to track the date of birth of the employees.

- **EmployeeEmail -** An email column to track the email address of each employee. This column can be used later to send emails to employees when an accident has been logged automatically.

- **EmployeePicture -** This will be an image column type, which we will use to store employee pictures and display the images in our app.

### LocationTable

This table will be used to track some details about the different work locations for our company. For the simplicity of the scenario, we will only track few details about our work locations.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Location Table showing location display names.](../media/2-location-table.png)](../media/2-location-table.png#lightbox)

- **LocationId -** This will be a number autogenerated column to identify the work location. Just like our EmployeeId, it is good practice to track locations by a number identifier. Some organizations prefer to refer to location numbers because it is faster and easier to identify, also commonly used in accounting systems.

- **LocationName -** Text column to track the actual name of the work location.

- **LocationCountry -** We will use a custom choice column to track the country or our work locations. Choice columns are a great way to limit any data entry errors, this will make it easier for users to enter data and good practice for data consistency.

- **TypeofAccidentTable -** This table will be used to track information about the types of accidents that usually occur at the workplace. For example, we will add a column here to rank an accident from 1 to 5 to define the severity of the accident. This column can later be used to do more reporting based on the number of accidents by severity ranking.

    > [![Screenshot of the Type of Accident Table with columns Display Name, Name and Data Type.](../media/3-type-accident-table.png)](../media/3-type-accident-table.png#lightbox)

- **TypeofAccidentId -** This will be a number autogenerated column to identify the type of accident. Just like the other IDs, it is common practice to have number identify data.

- **AccidentName -** Text column to describe the type of accident.

- **AccidentSeverity -** We will use a choice column to allow the user to pick a number from 1 to 5. One being minor severity and five being a catastrophic accident.

### AccidentsTable

This table will be the main table that will store the details about all the logged accidents. Think of this table as the one holding the details about each occurrence. In many databases, these tables are known as transactional tables because they contain details about transactions.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of Accidents Table that includes details about each accident occurrence.](../media/4-accident-table.png)](../media/4-accident-table.png#lightbox)

- **AccidentId -** This will be a number auto-generated column to identify the type of accident. Just like the other IDs, it is common practice to have number identify data.

- **LocationId -** This will be a lookup column; this column will link the main table back to our LocationTable. Later in this module we will refer to table relationships.

- **AccidentTypeId -** This will also be a lookup column; this column will link the main table back to TypeofAccidentTable.

- **AccidentDescription -** A free text column that will allow users to enter details about the accident.

- **AccidentDate** - A time and date column that will allow users to enter the exact time in which the accident took place.

- **ManagerComments** - A free text column in which managers can enter their comments and resolution of the accident.

- **ManagerReviewed** - We will use a choice column so that managers can denote which cases have been reviewed by management.

### Create a custom table

Follow the steps below to create the *EmployeeTable*.

1. To get started, navigate to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft credentials.

1. In the left navigation pane, expand the **Dataverse** menu, select **Tables** and then select **+New table**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Dataverse menu in the left navigation pane with the Tables and New Table options highlighted.](../media/5-new-table.png)](../media/5-new-table.png#lightbox)

1. Under the New table menu on the right, enter the following:

    - **Display Name:** *EmployeeTable*

    > [!NOTE]
    > The *Table* suffix is not required, it's a preference and will be used when creating tables throughout our scenario.

     **Plural display name** will populate automatically, you can choose to modify it, but in our case we will use the default.

    - **Primary Name Column Display Name:** *EmployeeId*

    > [!NOTE]
    > The primary name is the column shown to users when they select records from this table, also the column shown on the many side when a Lookup column is used.
    >
    You will notice in our example, the fields have a prefix of **cr533\_,** this is specific to our demo environment. When testing in your own environment this may look different.
    >
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the new table menu with the Display name highlighted.](../media/6-display-name.png)](../media/6-display-name.png#lightbox)

1. At the bottom, select **Create**.

    Next steps will be to set the *EmployeeId* field to be autonumber type.

1. Under the **Columns** tab, find the *EmployeeId* field and Select it.

1. On the columns tab, on the right, change the **Data type** from Text to **Autonumber**.

1. On the Autonumber type, select **String prefixed number**.

1. On the Minimum number of digits, enter **4**.

1. For the Seed value, enter **1000**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Autonumber type, Minimum number of digits and Seed value highlighted.](../media/7-auto-number.png)](../media/7-auto-number.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Done**.

1. In the bottom right, Select **Save Table**.

### Create custom table columns

Now that our table has been created, let's begin creating the columns we will use to store our employee data.

1. In the list of Tables, find and select the **EmployeesTable** we created in the previous section.

1. On the **Columns** tab, Select **+ Add column** and then in the **Column properties** pane on the right enter the following:

    - **Display name:** *EmployeeName*

    - **Data type:** *Text*

    - **Required:** *Required* (we want to prevent users from entering an employee record without a name)

    - **Searchable:** *Yes*

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Employee Name menu with Display name, Data type and Required fields highighted.](../media/8-employee-name.png)](../media/8-employee-name.png#lightbox)

1. Select **Done**.

     We will repeat the same process, steps 2 and 3, to create the remaining columns needed for the *EmployeeTable*. We will create a column for ***EmployeeDOB**, **EmployeeEmail** and **EmployeePicture**.*

    - **Display name:** *EmployeeDOB*

    - **Data type:** *Date Only*

    - **Required:** *Required* (we want to prevent users from entering an employee record without a date of birth)

    - **Searchable:** *Yes*

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of Employee Date of Birth columns with the Display name, Data type and required fields highlighted.](../media/9-employee-birth-date.png)](../media/9-employee-birth-date.png#lightbox)

    - **Display name:** *EmployeeEmail*

    - **Data type:** *Email* (This is a Dataverse data type that will prevent users from entering data that's not formatted in proper email format)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot showing the error sign when non-email format is used in an email data type column.](../media/10-employee-email.png)](../media/10-employee-email.png#lightbox)

    - **Required:** *Required* (we want to prevent users from entering an employee record without an email address)

    - **Searchable:** *Yes*

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Employee Email display name, Email Data type and Required fields highlighted.](../media/11-employee-email-data-type.png)](../media/11-employee-email-data-type.png#lightbox)

    - **Display name:** *EmployeePicture*

    - **Data type:** *Image*

    - **Primary image:** *Yes* (This will be used as the main employee picture)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Employee Picture Display name and Image Data type highlighted with Primary image checkbox selected.](../media/12-employee-picture.png)](../media/12-employee-picture.png#lightbox)

1. In the bottom right, select **Save Table**.
