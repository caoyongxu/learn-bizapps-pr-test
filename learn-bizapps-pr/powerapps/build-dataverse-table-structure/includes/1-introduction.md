In the Transform a business process to a model-driven app module (insert link to module) we were introduced to the data schema used in the employee accident tracking model-driven app. In this module we will focus on how to create those tables and build the relationships between the tables. This module will not cover all the details about tables in Dataverse, for more detailed information about tables see, [Tables in Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/entity-overview).
