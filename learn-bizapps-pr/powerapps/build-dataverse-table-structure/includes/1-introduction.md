In the previous module we were introduced to the data schema used in the employee accident tracking model-driven app. In this module we will focus on how to create those tables and build the relationships between the tables. This module will not cover all the details about tables in Dataverse, for more detailed information about tables see, [Tables in Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/entity-overview).

By the end of this course, students will:

- Create the necessary tables to build the sample model-driven app
- Create the relationships between the tables used in the solution
- Have a full understanding of the data model structure behind the model-driven app

## Prerequisites

The Target Audience should have a basic understanding of Microsoft model-driven apps and Dataverse.
