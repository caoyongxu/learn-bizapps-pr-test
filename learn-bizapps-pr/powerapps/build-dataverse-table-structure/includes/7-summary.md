This module explained the process of creating custom tables and columns. Having the correct table structure and column data types will make the model-driven app creation process much easier. The relationships and data model are fundamental components when you are creating apps. When the relationships are set properly, you will find it easier to create views that will allow the user to review relevant information, such as:

- Accidents that an employee has been involved in.

- Accidents in a specific location.

- Accidents that involve a specific type of accident.
