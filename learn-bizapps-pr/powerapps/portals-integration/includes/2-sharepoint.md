Model-driven Power Apps (including Dynamics 365 apps) supports integration with SharePoint Online, which enables you to use the document management capabilities of SharePoint that are related to Microsoft Dataverse records. Power Apps portals supports uploading and displaying documents to and from SharePoint directly on an entity form or web form in a portal. This feature allows portal users to view, download, add, and delete documents from a portal. Portal users can also create subfolders to organize their documents. Entity permissions determine if a user can view, upload, or delete documents.

- Document management works only with SharePoint Online.
- Document management is supported with server-based integration.

To work with the document management capabilities of SharePoint from within model-driven apps, you must complete the following parameters:

1. Enable document management functionality in the Dataverse environment.
1. Set up SharePoint integration from Power Apps portals admin center.
1. Enable document management for entities.
1. Configure the appropriate model-driven form to display documents.
1. Create the appropriate entity permission and assign it to the appropriate web role.

Watch the following video to learn how to enable SharePoint integration for your Dynamics 365 portal and give portal users access to the related documents.
