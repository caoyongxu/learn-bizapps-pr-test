Model-driven Power Apps (including Dynamics 365 apps) support integration with SharePoint Online that enables you to use the document management capabilities of SharePoint related to Common Data Service records. Power Apps portals supports uploading and displaying documents to and from SharePoint directly on an **entity form** or **web form** in a portal. This allows portal users to view, download, add, and delete documents from a portal. Portal users can also create subfolders to organize their documents. **Entity permissions** determine if a user can view, upload, or delete documents.

* Document management works only with SharePoint Online.
* Document management is supported with server-based integration.

To work with the document management capabilities of SharePoint from within model-driven apps, you must complete the following:

1. Enable document management functionality in the Common Data Service environment
1. Set up SharePoint integration from portal admin center
1. Enable document management for entities
1. Configure the appropriate model-driven form to display documents
1. Create appropriate **entity permission** and assign it to the appropriate **web role**
