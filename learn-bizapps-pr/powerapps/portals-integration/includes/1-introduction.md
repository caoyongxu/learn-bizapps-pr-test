Microsoft Power Apps portals has a number of features such as table lists, table forms, and the ability to use Liquid markup language that allows an app maker to build powerful web applications. However, you might encounter instances where you need to integrate your portal to web-based technologies to extend the scope of your application.

SharePoint document libraries can be added to table forms to allow portal users to view and upload files that are related to a specific Microsoft Dataverse record.

Power BI reports and dashboards can be added and configured in Power Apps portals studio as components to portal pages to show rich visualizations of data.

Adding components such as table lists, table forms, and Microsoft Power BI will add the corresponding Liquid tags to a portal page. Liquid markup language also has several Dataverse-specific tags that allow you to add items that don't appear as components such as model-driven charts and web forms.

The Iframe component allows for integration of other Microsoft technologies such as Power Virtual Agents and even canvas Power Apps to add to a Power Apps portal page.

Adding JavaScript code to a page can provide users with the ability to communicate with other applications with web APIs.
