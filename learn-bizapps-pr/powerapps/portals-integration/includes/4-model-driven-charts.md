You add a chart to a webpage by using the Liquid tag [chart](/learn/modules/liquid-template-language/?azure-portal=true). As with any Liquid code, you can add the `chart` tag in the page content inside a content snippet, or you can insert it as part of a web template.

```twig
{% chart id:"EE3C733D-5693-DE11-97D4-00155DA3B01E" viewid:"00000000-0000-0000-00AA-000010001006" %}
```

### Parameters

Two parameters are available for you to provide with the `chart` tag:

- **id** - Visualization identifier of the chart. You can get this parameter by exporting the chart.

- **viewid** - Table view identifier when it is opened in the model-driven view editor. If it's not specified, the default view will be used.

Showing a model-driven chart in Power Apps portals doesn't require additional configuration. Only system charts and system views are supported in configuration.

- To obtain the `chart id`, export the chart definition from a model-driven app and then look for `visualizationid` in the exported chart file.
- To obtain the `viewid`, start customizing the view and then copy the view ID from the URL.

Read privilege is asserted for the target table that is being queried in the chart. To allow users to view the chart, ensure that the appropriate **Table Permission** records are created and assigned to applicable web roles. If permission is not granted, the user will see an access denied message.

> [!NOTE]
> Different users might see different resulting charts based on their specific table permissions

Some chart types and some out-of-the-box charts aren't supported. For more information, see [Unsupported charts and chart types](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/add-chart?azure-portal=true#unsupported-charts-and-chart-types).
