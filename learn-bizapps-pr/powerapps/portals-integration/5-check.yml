  questions: 
  - content: How would you add a SharePoint document library to a Power Apps portal page?
    choices: 
    - content: Add an IFrame pointing to the SharePoint URL
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Adding a document location sub-grid on a model-driven form used for an entity form displays a SharePoint document library on the portal page. There's no SharePoint Liquid tag or component. Adding an IFrame pointing to the SharePoint URL won't show the documents related to that entity, provide security, or an ideal layout.
    - content: Using the `{% sharepoint %}` Liquid tag

  - content: You add a Power BI component to your portal page using the *Publish to web* access type, and in the source code editor add filtering to the Liquid tag. However, the portal users still see the entire dataset. What could be the issue?
    choices: 
    - content: The portal users need to be logged in
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: By default, the Power BI Liquid tag uses anonymous authentication which means Power BI will ignore the filter.  Portal users do not need to be logged in.  Refreshing the cache has no affect on Power BI data.  Row-level security won't affect Publish to web Power BI reports.
    - content: You will need to refresh the cache
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: By default, the Power BI Liquid tag uses anonymous authentication which means Power BI will ignore the filter.  Portal users do not need to be logged in.  Refreshing the cache has no affect on Power BI data.  Row-level security won't affect Publish to web Power BI reports.
    - content: The Power BI Liquid tag is not set to `authentication_type:"AAD"`
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: By default, the Power BI Liquid tag uses anonymous authentication which means Power BI will ignore the filter.  Portal users do not need to be logged in.  Refreshing the cache has no affect on Power BI data.  Row-level security won't affect Publish to web Power BI reports.
    - content: You need to configure row-level security in the Power BI dashboard
