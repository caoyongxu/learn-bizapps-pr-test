  questions: 
  - content: How would you add a SharePoint document library to a Power Apps portals page?
    choices: 
    - content: Add an Iframe element that points to the SharePoint URL.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Adding a document location subgrid on a model-driven form that is used for a table form will display a SharePoint document library on the portal page. A SharePoint Liquid tag or component is not available. Adding an Iframe element that points to the SharePoint URL won't show the documents that are related to that table, provide security, or an ideal layout.
    - content: Use the `{% sharepoint %}` Liquid tag.

  - content: You add a Power BI component to your portal page by using the Publish to web access type, and in the source code editor, you add filtering to the Liquid tag. However, portal users still see the entire dataset. What could be the issue?
    choices: 
    - content: The portal users need to be signed in.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: By default, the Power BI Liquid tag uses anonymous authentication, which means that Power BI will ignore the filter. Portal users do not need to be signed in. Refreshing the cache has no effect on Power BI data. Row-level security won't affect Publish to web Power BI reports.
