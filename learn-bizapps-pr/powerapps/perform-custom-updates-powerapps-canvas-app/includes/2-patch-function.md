The **Patch** function is used to create and edit records in a data
source when using a Form control doesn't meet your needs. Patch is used
most often when you need to take action on the data without user
interaction, in a repetitive manner, or your app design doesn't allow
for the use of forms.

Using Patch to create a record
------------------------------

The **Patch** function can be used to create a new record in your data
source. To create a new record, there are three parts to the formula.

1.  Include the name of the data source you want to edit. This could be
    a tabular data source (such as Common Data Service or SharePoint) or a
    collection. For the example, you will use **CustomerOrders** as the name
    of the data source.

2.  The **Defaults** function returns a record that contains the default
    values for the data source. If a column within the data source
    doesn't have a default value, that property won't be present. By
    using Defaults with the data source, this notifies Patch to create a
    new record.

3.  Include the columns that you want to populate in the new record. Here you
    will specify the name of the column to update followed by the value
    to write to that column. For this example, you will update the
    Region and Country column with a string value.

The example formula is as follows:

```
Patch(CustomerOrders, Defaults(CustomerOrders), {Region: "Americas", Country: "Canada"})
```

This formula will create a new record in the **CustomerOrders** data source and will set the Region to Americas and Country to Canada. Notice that you do not define any primary key information (the ID column) that will be updated by the data source according to its settings.

Using Patch to edit a record
----------------------------

It is also possible to edit a record in the data source. To edit a
single record, there are three parts to the formula.

1.  Include the name of the data source you want to edit. This could be
    a tabular data source (such as Common Data Service or SharePoint) or a
    collection. For the example, you will use **CustomerOrders** as the name
    of the data source.

2.  The record that you want to edit in the data source. The most common
    way to specify this record is to use the **LookUp** function to
    retrieve the record from the data source. Another option if you are
    using a Gallery and you want to update the current record is to use
    the **ThisItem** function for referencing the record. For this
    example, you will use a LookUp function.

3.  Include the changes that you want to make. Here you will specify the name
    of the column to update followed by the value to write to that
    column. For this example, you will update the Region and Country
    column with a string value.

The example formula is as follows:

```
Patch(CustomerOrders, LookUP(CustomerOrders, ID = 1), {Region: "Asia", Country: "China"})
```

This formula will update the record with an ID of 1 in the
**CustomerOrders** table by setting the Region column to Asia and the
Country column to China. If there are existing values in those fields,
it will be overwritten.

Updating columns with Patch
---------------------------

The primary logic of most Patch functions is updating the proper columns
with the correct information. This will be the source of most of your
troubleshooting of the Patch function. Use the following points to help
you work through Patch.

-   Make sure you are updating all of the required columns from your
    data source.

-   You can update as many or as few of the optional columns as you
    would like.

-   Make sure your column names are spelled and capitalized correctly.
    Column names are case-sensitive.

-   Make sure you are writing the correct data type. For example, if
    your column in the data source is a number type, then you cannot write a string value to it, even if that string contains a number.

There are four sources to pass values in your formula to Patch your data source:

-  You can hardcode a value. An example is if you want to patch the
    status of the record with "Pending", your Patch formula would look
    like:

    ```
    Patch(CustomerOrders, Default(CustomerOrders), {Status: "Pending"})
    ```

    This formula creates a new record and sets the Status column to the
    string value of "Pending".

-   You can reference a variable. For example, you can store the string
    "Under Review" in a variable named **varStatus** with the following
    formula.

    ```
    Set(varStatus, "Under Review")
    ```

    Then your Patch formula would be:

    ```
    Patch(CustomerOrders, Default(CustomerOrders), {Status: varStatus})
    ```

    This formula creates a new record and sets the Status column to the
    string value of "Under Review".

-  You can reference the value from the property of a control. An
    example would be setting the value from a drop-down menu named Dropdown1
    that contained the regions. Your Patch formula would look like:

    ```
    Patch(CustomerOrders, Default(CustomerOrders), {Status:
    Dropdown1.Selected.Value})
    ```

   This formula creates a new record and sets the Status column to the
    value of the selected item in the drop-down menu.

-  You can use the output of a formula. An example would be setting the
    value of the ModifiedBy column using the FullName from the
    **User()** function. Your Patch formula would look like:

   ```
   Patch(CustomerOrders, Default(CustomerOrders), {ModifiedBy:
    User().FullName})
    ```

   This formula creates a new record and sets the ModifiedBy column to
    the current user's FullName from Azure Active Directory.

## Patch example

Let’s take a look at another example, in this example you’re trying to build a simple solution for signing users into class as they arrive. This type of Power Apps solution is common and by using the Patch function it can be achieved with only a few steps. 

![Power Apps canvas app](..media/another-patch-example.png)

### Solution breakdown 

Here we have a simple Canvas app connected to our data source (TrainingClassSignIn). The data source has the following columns, **Training Class**, **FirstName**, **LastName**, **EmailAddress**, **SignInStatus**. This is the information we want to capture when a user selects the **Sign-in** button. In the formula bar, you see the following code: 

```powerappsfl
Patch(TrainingClassSignIn,Defaults(TrainingClassSignIn),{TrainingClass:TrainingClassDD.Selected.Value, FirstName:FirstNameInput.Text, LastName:LastNameInput.Text, EmailAddress:EmailAddressInput.Text, SignInStatus:"Attended"})
```
To elaborate, whenever someone selects the **Sign-in** button, a new record will be written to the TrainingClassSignIn data source. As to what data will be written back for the user signing in, you can see it’s getting this information from the Controls we added. You will also notice; it is setting the SignInStatus to “Attended” for each new record.  

As you can see, Patch is flexible and powerful. Patch has even more
capabilities including the ability to update multiple records and merge
records. For more information about these scenarios, see
