Sometimes it is necessary to work directly with your data source. In this module, you learned how to create, update, and delete data directly from your tabular data source. Here some key things to remember:

-   The **Patch** function is the multi-purpose function for creating and editing records directly in your data source when forms don't work for your scenario.

-   The **Remove** function allows you to delete a single record from
    your data source or collection.

-   The **RemoveIf** and **Clear** functions provide the capability to
    delete multiple or all the records from a given data source.

-   When deleting records in Power Apps there is no confirmation, undo,
    or recycle bin functionality. It is up to you to add that
    functionality if it is required in your app.
