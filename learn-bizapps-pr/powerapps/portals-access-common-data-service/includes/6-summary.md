The ability to easily surface and interact with Common Data Service data is one of the core benefits of implementing a Power Apps portal.  Entity lists and entity forms are easy to configure to enable access to the Common Data Service data in portals and turn content portals into functional web apps. They are easily configurable and extendable to satisfy many business requirements.

- Configure Entity Form and Web Form Metadata to access individual records.
- Display a list of data and an associated drill-down for details.
