The ability to display and interact with Microsoft Dataverse data is a core benefit of implementing a Power Apps portal. Entity lists and entity forms are simple to configure to enable access to Dataverse data in portals and turn content portals into functional web apps. They are configurable and extendable to satisfy many business requirements.

By now, you should be able to: 

- Describe the portal components that are available to display and interact with Dataverse data on a portal.
- Identify various features of portal components.
- Configure the **Entity Forms** and **Web Form Metadata** features to access individual records.
- Display a list of data and an associated drill-down list for details.

## Next steps

You have learned how to enable access to Dataverse data for portal audiences. The next step would be to learn how to use Liquid code in the portal to satisfy complex requirements.
