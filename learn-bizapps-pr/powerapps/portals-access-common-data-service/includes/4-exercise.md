The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with hands-on experience in adding a list and a form to a Power Apps portal.

## Learning objectives

At the end of these exercises, you will be able to:

- Add a list component to a portal page.
- Add a form component to a portal page.
- Configure the list component to drill down and view details of the record.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are necessary for completing these exercises:

- Access to the Power Apps maker portal.
- Ideally, you will have the default sample Microsoft Dataverse apps and data, but you can use other Dataverse entities.
- You will need to have provisioned a Power Apps portal to complete the exercise. If you do not have a provisioned portal, go to [Create Portal](/powerapps/maker/portals/create-portal/?azure-portal=true) to create one.

> [!TIP]
> The exercises work best when you have sample data to work with. When you provision a Dataverse environment, you have the opportunity to add sample apps and data.  Review the [Create Environment](/power-platform/admin/create-environment.md?azure-portal=true#create-an-environment-with-a-database) steps to provision a Dataverse environment with sample apps and data.

## Scenario

## High-level steps

To finish the exercise, complete the following tasks:

- Create a webpage and add a list component that is linked to a Dataverse table.
- Create a child webpage with a form component to display details for a Dataverse table.
