This module covered a lot of new information in working with canvas apps. You should be able to recall many new functions and have a better picture of how to tie all of the elements together. You can tie in your data, consider your users, and grasp the more technical aspects of building a canvas app. As you can see, you can customize all parts of a canvas app. Take some time to make this app your own. Change the colors or try filtering on a different field. In a canvas app, your imagination is your main limitation.
