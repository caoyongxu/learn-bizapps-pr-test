## Create a custom connector from an OpenAPI document ##

There are several ways of creating a custom connector for Power Apps. In this exercise, you will create one using an OpenAPI document. Suppose you have an OpenAPI document named `openapi.json` and an API access key provided by the professional development team.

1. After logging into [Power Apps][pa] dashboard, open the `Data` blade and click the `Custom Connectors` menu on the left-hand side. Then, click the `➕ New custom connector` button at the right-top corner and select the `Import an OpenAPI file` menu.

1. When a pop-up modal appears, give the name, **InventoryManager**, to the `Connector name` field and click the `Import` button to import the OpenAPI document, `openapi.json`. Then, click the `Continue` button.
