While Power Apps offer hundreds of connectors to connect to Microsoft and non-Microsoft services, you may want to communicate with services that are not available as prebuilt connectors like the Inventory Management API. Custom connectors address this scenario by allowing you to create a connector with its own actions.

* As a professional developer, you can create a custom connector from API Management by exporting the APIs.
* As a citizen developer, as long as you have an OpenAPI document, you can create a custom connector within Power Apps by importing the OpenAPI document.

To sum up, this module has covered the following topics:

* How to create a custom connector from Azure API Management by exporting the APIs,
* How to create a custom connector from the OpenAPI document by importing it,
* Demonstrate the differences between a connector and a connection,
* How to create a connection for the custom connector by providing authentication details,
* How to test the custom connector by using the existing connection details.
* How to add the custom connector to a Power Apps app, and
* How to call an API through the custom connector.
