# Summary

In this module, you looked at application lifecycle management with the Power Platform, including:

- Learning about Microsoft vision and Solution Architectâ€™s role in ALM

- Creating an environment strategy

- Defining a solution structure for your deliverables

- Automating deployments with Azure DevOps

As a solution architect you should understand how to:

- Establish ALM process and procedures. Establishing application lifecycle management process should be done at the start of the project/

- Create repeatable process. Having a repeatable process saves time and ensures consistent results.

- Designing ALM to fit your project. ALM is not a one size fits all, you must size it to fit your project.

- Proper environment access has been established, e.g.,  Security Groups.
- Data loss prevention policies are correct for solution environments.
- Service Principals and service accounts necessary for connections are in place and configured.
- Environment settings have been documented and configured in each environment.
