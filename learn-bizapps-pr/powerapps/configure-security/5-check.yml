  - content: You created a new role called Partner Manager and want to grant users in this role with the permission to edit all contacts within the user's parent account. What scope would you select for the table permission?
    choices: 
    - content: Contact scope
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Use Account scope and then specify parent account relationship. With Account scope, a signed-in user in the role for which the permission record is defined will have the rights granted by that permission only for records that are related to that user's parent account record through a selected Dataverse relationship.

      isCorrect: true

  - content: You added a Dynamic Lookup Filter to your table list so that you can filter the list by currency. However, at runtime, the list of available currencies in the filter is empty. You double-checked your Dataverse instance, which shows that active currency records do exist. What do you need to do to display currencies in the filter?
    choices: 
    - content: Remove and then add the filter again
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Whenever Dataverse data is accessed by using methods other than Entity List or Entity Form, table permissions are applied automatically, including metadata filters where the Dynamic Lookup Filter is used. For a table to display lookup values, a table permission record is required.

      isCorrect: false

  - content: You have a product list page that uses a table list to display the data. You have configured Read  permissions for the product list table and have set the scope to Global. Users have complained that they can browse a product listing page anonymously but are denied access to the page after they sign in. How would you resolve the issue?
    choices: 
    - content: Change the scope to Contact
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: One of the web roles in the portal can be marked as Anonymous and another one as Authenticated. These roles allow you to apply permissions and access rules to all portal users based on whether they access the site anonymously or if they are signed in. Because users can access the data anonymously but can’t when they’re authenticated, it indicates that the table permission is associated with the Anonymous role but not with the Authenticated one.
