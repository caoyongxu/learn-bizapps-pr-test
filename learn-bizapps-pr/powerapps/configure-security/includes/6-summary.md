Power Apps portals provides webpage access security by creating a **Web Page Access Control Rule** record for a specific webpage. To provide security to Common Data Service entities, an **Entity Permission** record is created for a specific Common Data Service entity. Both the **Web Page Access Control Rule** record and the **Entity Permission** record can be associated to a **Web Role** record, which can be associated to a Common Data Service contact record. When a Common Data Service contact is an authenticated portal user, the permissions and access will determine which pages and data they can view and interact with. 

This module explained the following concepts:

- The relationship between a Common Data Service contact entity and a portal user.
- The **Web Role** record and how it is used in portal security.
- Restricting access to webpages by using webpage access control rules.
- Restricting or providing access to Common Data Service on portal webpages by using entity permissions.
- Configuring a security model in a Power Apps portal.
