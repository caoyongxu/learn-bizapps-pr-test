The solution architect has a unique role in the deployment activities of a Power Platform solution. The solution architect is one of the people who knows best how the solution works and are one of the key people responsible for the success of the deployment. The solution architect will be a focus point for the project during the implementation phase.

Too often deployment activities such as testing, data migration, and go live planning are left to the last minute and are frequently understaffed. The solution architect must champion the need for these efforts to start as early as possible within the project. The solution architect must ensure they have shared the knowledge and guidance on the solution architecture to effectively plan and execute go-live.

In this module, you looked at the role of the solution architect in relation to testing, data migration, and go live including during:

- Performance testing.

- Data migration.

- Deployment planning.

- Go-live.

## Next steps
