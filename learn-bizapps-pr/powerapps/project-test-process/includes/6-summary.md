The solution architect has a unique role in the deployment activities of a Microsoft Power Platform solution. The solution architect is one of the people who knows best how the solution works and is among the key people who are responsible for the success of the deployment. The solution architect will be a focal point for the project during the implementation phase.

Often, deployment activities such as testing, data migration, and go-live planning are left for the last minute and are frequently understaffed. The solution architect must champion the need for these efforts to start as early as possible within the project. Solution architects must ensure that they have shared the knowledge and guidance on the solution architecture to effectively plan and implement go-live.

In this module, you reviewed the role of the solution architect in relation to testing, data migration, and go-live, including during the following tasks:

- Performance testing

- Data migration

- Deployment planning

- Go-live

## Next steps

The next steps are to look at application lifecycle management in Microsoft Power Platform.
