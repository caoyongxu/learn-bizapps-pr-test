  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: What is user acceptance testing used for?
    choices: 
    - content: To ensure the system works as expected.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: User acceptance testing is performed by end users to ensure the system works as expected in day-to-day activities. UAT is critical to ensure go-live sign-out and acceptance of the new system.
    - content: To ensure the system performs to the SLA.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is performance testing.
    - content: To validate existing historical data.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is data validation testing of migrated data.
    - content: To test the system after an update.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is regression testing.
  - content: What is required for performance testing?
    choices: 
    - content: Sample data
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Performance testing requires volumes of data that represent real loads not a sample of data.
    - content: Sandbox environment
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Performance testing should be performed on a separate environment. The environment should be a Production type environment not a Sandbox that has fewer resources allocated.
    - content: Test environment for integrations.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Integrations are tested as part of integration testing not performance testing. Performance testing is for the Power Platform solution not a test platform for an external system.
    - content: Live volumes of data
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Performance testing requires realistic volume of data for a valid test.
  - content: When should the deployment plan be prepared?
    choices: 
    - content: After development is complete.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The deployment plan should be started as early in the project as possible.
    - content: As soon as possible.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The deployment plan should be started as early in the project as possible. The deployment plan is important as it helps guide towards a successful deployment.
    - content: During the go-live review.
      isCorrect: false    
      explanation: The deployment plan should be started as early in the project as possible.
    - content: At the same time, as the statement of work.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The statement of work is before the project has started. The solution components have not been chosen and designed and it is not possible to create the deployment plan without this information.
