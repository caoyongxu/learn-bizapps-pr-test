  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: What is user acceptance testing used for?
    choices: 
    - content: To ensure that the system works as expected
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: User acceptance testing (UAT) is performed by users to ensure that the system works as expected in daily activities. UAT is critical to ensure go-live sign-out and acceptance of the new system.
    - content: To ensure that the system performs to the service-level agreement (SLA)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This option is describing performance testing.
    - content: To validate existing historical data
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This option is describing data validation testing of migrated data.
    - content: To test the system after an update
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This option is describing regression testing.
  - content: What is required for performance testing?
    choices: 
    - content: Sample data
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Performance testing requires volumes of data that represent real loads, not a sample of data.
    - content: Sandbox environment
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Performance testing should be performed on a separate environment. The environment should be a Production type environment, not a sandbox environment that has fewer resources allocated.
    - content: Test environment for integrations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Integrations are tested as part of integration testing, not performance testing. Performance testing is for Microsoft Power Platform solution, not a test platform for an external system.
    - content: Live volumes of data
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Performance testing requires a realistic volume of data for a valid test.
  - content: When should the deployment plan be prepared?
    choices: 
    - content: After development is complete
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The deployment plan should be started as early in the project as possible.
    - content: As soon as possible
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The deployment plan should be started as early in the project as possible. The deployment plan is important because it helps guide toward a successful deployment.
    - content: During the go-live review
      isCorrect: false    
      explanation: The deployment plan should be started as early in the project as possible.
    - content: At the same time as the statement of work
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The statement of work happens before the project has started. The solution components have not been chosen and designed, and it is not possible to create the deployment plan without this information.
