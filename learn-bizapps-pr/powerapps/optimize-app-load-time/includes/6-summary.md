In thisâ€¯module, we explored how you can evaluate and improve app load times. By regularly reviewing and measuring your app, you can proactively identify and remediate startup performance problems. Power Apps Monitor tool can help identify formulas that are slowing the app down. Keeping your app updated with current app settings recommendations can help ensure you get the best performance. Also, by configuring only the connectors required, you can avoid friction of users signing into connectors that aren't in use. By establishing a data load strategy, you can ensure you balance the need to defer loading data with the performance of having it pre-loaded on startup. Working to make your app load as quickly as possible and providing visual feedback when appropriate can help increase user satisfaction with your app.
