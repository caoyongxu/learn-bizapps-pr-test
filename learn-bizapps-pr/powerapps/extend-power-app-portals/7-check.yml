  - content: You have a requirement to set a default value on an entity form and also to hide the field. What is the most efficient method to complete the task?
    choices: 
    - content: Use business rules on the model-driven form.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Business rules on the model-driven form will not apply to the portal. A JavaScript function would work, but it is not the most efficient method. Hiding the field on the form designer will not set the default value. An Entity Form Metadata record has the ability to set a default value and hide the field by using the CSS class value of "hide."
    - content: Create a JavaScript function.
