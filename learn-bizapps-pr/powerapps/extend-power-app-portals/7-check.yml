  - content: You have a requirement to set a default value on an Entity Form and also to hide the field.  What is the most efficient method to complete the task?
    choices: 
    - content: Use Business Rules on the model-driven form
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Business rules on the model-driven form will not apply to the portal.  A JavaScript function would work but is not the most efficient method.  Simply hiding the field on the form designer will not set the default value.  An Entity Form Metadata record has the ability to both set a default value and hide the field using the CSS class value of "hide."
    - content: Create a JavaScript function

  - content: You have configured a Power Apps portal on a development environment and you need to move the configuration to your test environment.  What tool would you use to accomplish this?
    choices: 
    - content: Power Apps portals admin center
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The Power Apps portals admin center does not have any tools to migrate portal metadata.  Exporting and Importing Excel files would lead to problems with data relationships as well as potential duplicates of web pages.  The Configuration Data Migration Tool can use the Portal Schema files and Export and Import portal metadata.  The Common Data Service solution does not contain portal metadata.

  - content: How would you calculate taxes based on rates stored in the Common Data Service on work orders entered on Web Forms on the portal?
    choices: 
    - content: Add JavaScript to the Web Form Steps
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You would not be able to query the rate information using JavaScript on the Web Form steps.  Creating an external web service would not be the most efficient way to calculate the taxes.  A plug-in would fire when the data is saved to CDS and can update a tax value based on rates in another entity.  Common Data Service calculated fields cannot pull information (rates) from other records.
