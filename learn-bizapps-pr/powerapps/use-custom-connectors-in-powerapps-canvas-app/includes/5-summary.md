Custom connectors are an excellent way of extending apps because they can access resources outside of the readily available connectors for Power Apps. This module covered what custom connectors are and how to use them across different platforms, such as Power Apps, Power Automate, and Azure Logic Apps. This module also covered the custom connectors lifecycle, and how to create one using Postman. Here are some points to remember:

-   Custom connectors provide a way to extend apps by calling APIs,
    services, and systems for scenarios tailored toward your business
    needs.

-   After you create a custom connector, it can be shared with other users
    inside the organization. To share it outside of the organization,
    submit it to Microsoft for certification.

-   Using Postman is one of the most common approaches to create custom
    connectors.
