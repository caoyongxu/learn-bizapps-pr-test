Now that you understand what custom connectors are and how their
lifecycle works, you can learn how to build custom connectors using a
Postman collection.

Postman is an app for making HTTP requests. Postman collections help
you organize and group related API requests. Collections can make custom
connector development faster and easier if you don't have an OpenAPI
definition for your API. For more information about collections, see
[Creating
collections](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/creating_collections).

Create a Postman collection for a custom connector
--------------------------------------------------

There are some prerequisites needed to create a Postman collection for a
custom connector:

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) app

- [API
 key](/connectors/custom-connectors/index?azure-portal=true#get-an-api-key)
 for the Cognitive Services Text Analytics API

### Create an HTTP request for the API

1. In Postman, on the **Builder** tab, select the HTTP method, enter
 the request URL for the API endpoint, and select an authorization
 protocol.

![Screenshot of creating an API HTTP Request.](../media/01-create-api-http-request.png)

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| :---------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP method | "POST" |
| Request URL | <span>https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/sentiment</span> |
| Authorization | "No Auth" (you specify an API key in the next step) |

2. Enter key-value pairs for the request header. For common HTTP
 headers, you can select from the drop-down list.

![Screenshot of the Create API HTTP Request header steps.](../media/02-create-api-http-request-header.png)

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| Headers | Key: “Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key” Value: your-API-subscription-key, which you can find in your Cognitive Services account Key: “Content-Type” Value: “application/json” |

3. Enter content that you want to send in the request body. To check
 that the request works by getting a response back, select **Send**.

    ![Screenshot of the Create API HTTP Request Body steps.](../media/03-create-api-http-request-body.png)

    ```json
    {
    “documents”: [{
    “language”: “en-us”,
    “id”: “1”,
    “text”: “I enjoyed the new movie after a long day.”
    }]
    }
    ```

4. The response field contains the full response from the API,
 including the result or an error, if any occurred.

![Screenshot of the Create API HTTP Request Response steps.](../media/04-create-api-http-request-response.png)

For more information about HTTP requests, see
[Requests](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/requests).

### Save the collection

1. Select **Save**.

![Screenshot of the Save Request button.](../media/05-save-request.png)

2. Under **Save Request**, enter a request name and a description. The
 custom connector uses these values for the API operation summary and
 description.

![Screenshot of the Save Request window with the name and description.](../media/06-save-request.png)

 | **Parameter** | **Value** |
 | :---------------------| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Request name | "DetectSentiment" |
 | Request description | \"The API returns a numeric score between 0 and 1. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, while scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment.\" |

3. Choose **+ Create Collection** and provide a collection name. The
 custom connector uses this value when you call the API. Select the
 check mark, which creates a collection folder, then choose **Save to
 SentimentDemo**.

![Screenshot of the Save Request window with features highlighted.](../media/07-save-request.png)

 | **Parameter** | **Value** |
 | :-----------------| :-----------------|
 | Collection name | "SentimentDemo" |

### Save the request response

Now that you've saved your request, you can save the response. That
way, the response appears as an example when you load the request later.

1. Above the response window, select **Save Response**.

![Screenshot of the Create API HTTP Request Save Response button.](../media/08-create-api-http-request-save-response.png)

Custom connectors support only one response per request. If you save multiple responses per request, only the first one is used.

2. At the top of the app, provide a name for your example response, and
 select **Save Example**.

![Screenshot of the Create API HTTP Request Save example button.](../media/09-create-api-http-request-save-response.png)

If your API had additional features, you would continue to build your
Postman collection with any additional requests and responses.

Export the Postman collection
-----------------------------

You can now export the collection as a JSON file, which you will then
import using the custom connector wizard. However, before you export the
collection, remove the content type and security headers - these were
required to make API requests, but they are handled differently in the
custom connector.

1. Under **Headers**, hover over each header, and choose the **X** next
 to the header to remove it. Select **Save** to save the collection
 again.

![Screenshot of the Remove headers steps.](../media/10-remove-headers.png)

2. Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the collection, and then
 choose **Export**.

![Screenshot of the Export HTTP Request steps.](../media/11-export-http-request.png)

3. Select the **Collection v1** export format, select **Export**, then
 browse to the location where you want to save the JSON file.

![Screenshot of the Export Collection window with steps highlighted.](../media/12-export-format.png)

Create a custom connector from the Postman collection
-----------------------------------------------------

You created the Postman collection and now want to use it to create a
custom connector. Before proceeding, there are some prerequisites needed
to create the custom connector from the Postman collection created earlier:

- Download the Postman collection you created

- An [API
 key](/connectors/custom-connectors/index?azure-portal=true#get-an-api-key)
 for the Cognitive Services Text Analytics API

- A
 [Power Apps](/powerapps/signup-for-powerapps/?azure-portal=true)
 subscription

Import the Postman collection
-----------------------------

Now you're ready to work with the Postman collection you created earlier.
The collection contains most of the required information.
You can review it and update it as you go through the custom connector
wizard. You need to import the Postman collection for Power Apps and Power Automate.

### Import the Postman collection for Power Apps and Power Automate

1. Go to
 [powerapps.com](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/)
 or
 [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and sign in.

2. In the upper-right corner, select the gear icon and then select
 **Custom connectors**.

:::image type="icon" source="../media/13-icon-gear.png":::

3. Choose **Create custom connector**, then select **Import a Postman collection**.

![Screenshot of the Flow Apps Create Connector steps.](../media/14-flow-apps-create-connector.png)

4. Enter a name for the custom connector, then navigate to the Postman
 collection that you created, and select **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the Flow Apps upload collection steps.](../media/15-flow-apps-upload-collection.png)

 | **Parameter** | **Value** |
 | :------------------------| :-----------------|
 | Custom connector title | "SentimentDemo" |

The wizard imports the collection then converts it to an OpenAPI definition named generatedApiDefinition.swagger.json.

Update general details
----------------------

This example shows the Power Automate user interface, but the
steps are similar same across all three technologies. However, any
differences will be pointed out.

1. On the **General** page, review the imported information from the
 Postman collection, including the API host and the base URL for the
 API. The connector uses the API host and the base URL to determine
 how to call the API.

![Screenshot of the General page with detailed information.](../media/16-page-general.png)

2. Update the description to something meaningful. This description
 displays in the custom connector's details, and it can help others
 decide if the connector would be useful to them.

 | **Parameter** | **Value** |
 | :---------------| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Description | \"Uses the Cognitive Services Text Analytics Sentiment API to determine whether the text is positive or negative.\" |

Specify the authentication type
-------------------------------

There are several options available for authentication in custom
connectors. For this tutorial, the Cognitive Services APIs use API key
authentication.

1. On the **Security** page, under **Authentication type**,
 choose **API Key**.

![Screenshot of the Authentication Type set as API key.](../media/17-authentication-type.png)

2. Under **API Key**, specify a parameter label, name, and location.
 Specify a meaningful label, because this is displayed when someone
 first makes a connection with the custom connector. The parameter
 name and location must match what the API expects (in this case, the
 header you specified in Postman). Select **Connect**.

![Screenshot of the API Key Parameter settings.](../media/18-api-key-parameters.png)

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| :--------------------| :-----------------------------|
| Parameter label | "API key" |
| Parameter name | "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" |
| Parameter location | "Header" |

3. At the top of the wizard, make sure the name is set to
 \"SentimentDemo\", then select **Create connector**.

Review and update the connector definition
------------------------------------------

The custom connector wizard gives you many options for defining how
your connector functions, and how it is exposed in Power Apps, Power Automate,
 and Azure Logic Apps. The next section explains the user interface (UI) and covers a few options, but you are also encouraged to explore this on your own.

### Review the UI and definition

Before you learn about the specific steps on the **Definition** page,
here's a review of the user interface.

1. This area displays any actions, triggers (for Logic Apps and
 Power Automate), and references that are defined for the connector.
 In this case, the DetectSentiment action from the Postman collection
 is displayed. There are no triggers in this connector, but you can
 learn about triggers for custom connectors in [Use webhooks with
 Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate](/connectors/custom-connectors/create-webhook-trigger/?azure-portal=true).

![Screenshot of the Actions, Triggers, and References.](../media/19-definition-actions-triggers.png)

2. The **General** area displays information about the action or
 trigger currently selected. This information comes from the Postman
 collection. You can edit the information here, including
 the **Visibility** property for operations and parameters in a logic
 app or flow:

- **none** - Typically displayed in the logic app or flow.
- **advanced** - Hidden under an additional menu.
- **internal** - Hidden from the user.
- **important** - Always shown to the user first.

![Screenshot of the General area with information about the action or triggered selected.](../media/20-definition-general.png)

3. The **Request** area displays information based on the HTTP request
 included in the Postman collection. In this case, the
 HTTP *verb* is **POST**, and the URL is
 "/text/analytics/v2.0/sentiment" (the full URL to the API is
 "[https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/sentiment](https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/sentiment)").

![Screenshot of the Request area with information displayed based on the HTTP request.](../media/21-definition-request.png)

4. The **Response** area displays information based on the HTTP
 response included in the Postman collection. In this case, the only
 response defined is for "200" (a successful response), but you can
 define additional responses.

![Screenshot of the only Response set to 200.](../media/22-definition-response.png)

5. The **Validation** area displays any issues detected in the API
 definition. Make sure to check this area before you save a
 connector.

![Screenshot of the Validation succeeded message.](../media/23-definition-validation.png)

### Update the definition

Next you will change a few things so the connector is more user-friendly when someone uses it in Power Apps, Power Automate, or Azure Logic Apps.

1. In the **General** area, update the summary to \"Returns a numeric
 score representing the sentiment detected\".

2. In the **Request** area, select **body** then **Edit**.

![Screenshot of the Request area with body edit highlighted.](../media/24-request-body.png)

3. In the **Parameter** area, you now see the three parameters that the
 API expects: ID, language, and text. Select **id** then **Edit**.

![Screenshot of the Parameter area with the ID edit selected.](../media/25-request-body-id.png)

4. In the **Schema Property** area, update values for the parameter,
 then select **Back**.

![Screenshot of the Schema Property area with values set.](../media/26-request-edit-schema.png)

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| :---------------| :----------------------------------------------------|
| Title | "ID" |
| Description | "An identifier for each document that you submit." |
| Default value | "1" |
| Is required | "Yes" |

5. In the **Parameter** area, select **language** and then select **Edit**. Repeat the process you used for ID with the following values.

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| :---------------| :----------------------------------------------------|
| Title | "Language" |
| Description | "The 2 or 4 character language code for the text." |
| Default value | "en" |
| Is required | "Yes" |

6. In the **Parameter** area, choose **text** then **Edit**, and repeat
 the process you used for ID and language, with the following values.

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| :---------------| :--------------------------------------|
| Title | "Text" |
| Description | "The text to analyze for sentiment." |
| Default value | None |
| Is required | "Yes" |

7. In the **Parameter** area, choose **Back** to take you back to the
 main definition page.

8. At the top right of the wizard, select **Update connector**.

### Test the connector

Now that you\'ve created the connector test it to make sure it works
properly.

1. On the **Test** page, choose **New connection**.

![Screenshot of the New Connection on the Test page.](../media/27-new-connection.png)

2. Enter the API key from the Text Analytics API, then select **Create
 connection**.

![Screenshot of the API key and Create Connection button.](../media/28-create-connection.png)

3. Return to the **Test page**.
In Power Automate, go back to the **Test** page. Choose the refresh icon to make sure that the connection information is updated.

![Screenshot of the Refresh Connection button.](../media/29-refresh-connection.png)

In Power Apps, go back to the list of connections available in the current environment. In the upper-right corner, select the gear icon, then select **Custom connectors**. Choose the connector that you created, then go back to the **Test** page.

:::image type="icon" source="../media/13-icon-gear.png":::

4. On the **Test** page, enter a value for the **text** field (the
 other fields use the defaults that you set earlier), and then
 select **Test operation**.

![Screenshot of the text field and Test Operation button.](../media/30-test-operation.png)

5. The connector calls the API. You can review the response, which
 includes the sentiment score.
