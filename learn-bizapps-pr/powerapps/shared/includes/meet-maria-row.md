     Maria works in inventory management and makes sure Van Arsdel runs like a well-oiled machine. She verifies the warehouse has enough parts and if not orders more using a legacy system that Kiana wrote. But more than that â€“ she performs audits on the inventory, checks with vendors for the best prices, and other inventory supply management tasks.
