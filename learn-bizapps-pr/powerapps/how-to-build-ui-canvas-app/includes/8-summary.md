There are many options available to enhance the usability and appearance
of your app. Throughout this module, you explored themes, properties for
changing a control's appearance, using icons and images,
personalization, and the different form factors available. Some
important items to remember are:

-   There are several out-of-the box or default themes to choose from
    and these can be easily applied.

-   By modifying various Control properties, you can completely change
    how the control looks and functions when users interact with the
    app.

-   Use the User() function to personalize the app. For example, create
    a Welcome screen and greet the user by using the User() function.

-   You must select the form factor when you begin building your app.
    After you have selected tablet or mobile, it cannot be changed. With
    the tablet form factor, you can adjust the screen size.
