When provisioning a Power Apps portal, the most important choices to consider are the audience, workload, and choosing a specific portal template that would best align with the particular business requirements.

A number of portal templates are available that can be provisioned. These templates will accelerate the configuration of a portal based on the intended audience and workload.

If you are building a custom business application by using Microsoft Dataverse without Dynamics 365 apps enabled, your only choice is the **Portal from blank** option.

If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Service, you have a choice of five additional portal templates:

- Community portal
- Customer self-service
- Employee self-service
- Partner portal
- Custom portal (Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management)

> [!NOTE]
> Specific features and components of one specific starter portal can be added to another starter portal, as required.

## Portal templates

| Portal template       | Audience          | Workload                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Community             | Partner, Customer | Choose this option to provision a portal that is focused on an online community. This portal will contain features such as forums, ideas, blogs, and case management. |
| Customer self-service | Partner, Customer | This option provides the ability for portal users to search knowledge articles, submit cases, and participate in discussion forums to resolve issues. |
| Employee self-service | Employee          | This portal allows employees to access a centralized knowledge article and to also submit cases. |
| Partner               | Partner           | Choose this option to build a portal where external partners can manage and collaborate on accounts and opportunities. Add-ons are available for Dynamics 365 Field Service or Dynamics 365 Project Service. |
| Portal from blank     | Other             | The **Portal from blank** option is meant for unique line-of-business scenarios where the other templates are not a good fit. The portal can be configured to address a variety of requirements. If **Portal from blank** is provisioned within a Dataverse environment with Dynamics 365 apps enabled, specific features from the other portals can be incorporated into the portal later. |
| Customer portal       | Enterprise B2B    | The Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management Customer portal is a template that provides portal access to Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management data by using dual-write Dataverse entities. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review current licensing guides to determine the licenses, subscriptions, and capacity that is required for internal and external authenticated users and anonymous page views. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544) or the 
[Power Apps Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130). Integration to other services such as SharePoint, Power BI, or Azure Blob storage will require appropriate capacity and licensing.

Make sure that you define the type of audience who will visit the new portal. The audience will determine which options of portals you will be given.

## Portal features

All portal templates are built on a common foundation (portal base) and include the following features:

- Ability to configure the portal by using the Portal studio.
- Content management, including content publishing, design, theming, search, multi-lingual support, and templating.
- Extensibility that is built on webpages, templates, entity forms, entity lists, and more. 
- Security that is based on identity management, integration with authentication providers, web roles, content permissions, and entity permissions.
- Common features like ads, polls, ratings, and comments. These features are not standalone and can be used throughout other parts of the implementation. For example, ratings and comments can be enabled for a page, and ads can be included as part of a template. Some features will require Dynamics 365 apps to be enabled. For example, knowledge articles require a Microsoft Dynamics 365 app.

Where the portal templates are different is around the functional areas that target *specific business processes* such as case management. These features are deployed as additional managed solutions, making it easier to add missing features if necessary.

<sup>^</sup> Support for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as authentication provider is included in the portal base. The Azure AD Authentication feature, as used by the Employee self-service portal, is different. In the Employee self-service portal, the sign-in process validates that the user has a required Dynamics 365 license and access is denied if the user does not have a Dynamics 365 license assigned.

If a particular feature, for example case management, is available in two different templates, it will be the same feature offering the same functionality.

## Additional considerations

The following sections explain the additional factors that you should consider when choosing the correct portal template.

### Dependencies

Some portal templates have prerequisites for their installation, so an installation will fail if the prerequisites are not met. For example, to install Field Service for a Partner portal, the Partner portal and Field Service solutions must have already been installed. If you attempt to install Field Service first, the installation will fail and give you an error message. If Dynamics 365 apps are not enabled, the only available portal template will be **Portal from blank**.

### Employee portal access 

When an employee accesses the portal functionality, an appropriate Dynamics 365 or Power Apps license might be required. The simplest way to assess the licensing requirements is to keep in mind that the requirements do not change based on the method of access; they are the same regardless of whether an employee accesses Dynamics 365 by using a portal or through one of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps. 

For example, if an employee has a Dynamics 365 Customer Service license assigned, they cannot manage opportunities by using the Partner portal because access to opportunities requires a Dynamics 365 Sales license.

The license that is required depends on the entities and functionalities that are accessed. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409) or [Power Apps Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085130&clcid=0x409).

### Other solutions

Other solutions add features to the portal that can greatly enhance user experience. Some of these capabilities might be agnostic to the choice of template, for example: 

- Live chat and Cobrowse
- Click to call
- Customer journey tracking

Alternatively, Power Platform and Dynamics 365 independent software vendors and partners that offer Power Platform and Dynamics 365 vertical solutions might often include portal extensions that are designed for their solution needs. When you are working with a vendor who offers portals as part of their overall solution, it would be sensible to discuss portal requirements and the portal template selection beforehand.
