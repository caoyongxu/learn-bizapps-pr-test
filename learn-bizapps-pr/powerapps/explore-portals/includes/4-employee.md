The Employee Self Service Portal provides organizations with a portal configured to assist employees with finding specific human resources and company information or resolving employee specific issues.

> [!NOTE]
> The Employee Self Service Portal is only available on Common Data Service environments with Dynamics 365 apps enabled.

By default the Employee Self Service portal is configured to authenticate using Azure Active Directory, providing the employees with a single sign-on experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Organizations are required to have a current Dynamics 365 Team license subscription for each employee accessing the Employee Self Service Portal.

Employees are able to do the following;

## Knowledge Articles

The Knowledge Article feature of the Employee Self Service Portal operates as described in the Community Portal.  However, this feature would be more geared to supporting employees than customers.

Knowledge Articles covering various Human Resource or corporate policies and procedures are available to be searched on a Portal.

This would also require the internal department (for example, a Human Resource team) to use the Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub app to manage and maintain applicable Knowledge Articles.

## Forums

The Forum functionality in the Employee Self Service Portal operates the same way as it does for the Community and Customer Self Service portals.  However, the discussions would typically be only available to internal staff and follow topics related to Employee Self Service.

## Support Cases

The support Cases functionality is the same as described in the Community and Customer Self Service Portals.  For the Employee Self Service portal, the customers would represent internal employees of an organization.

This would require the internal department  being contacted for support (for example, a Human Resource or internal IT team) to use the Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub app to monitor and respond to support cases from employees.
