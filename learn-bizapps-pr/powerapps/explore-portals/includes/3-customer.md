The Customer Self-Service starter portal is for any organization that needs to provide customer support services. Dynamics 365 Customer Service features are extended to the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The Customer Service Portal is only available on Common Data Service environments with Dynamics 365 apps enabled.

Similar to the Community Portal, the features for both self-service and assisted service scenarios are included, though the emphasis is on the assisted service scenarios and some self-service features such as blogs, are not included.

The Customer Self-Service portal provides the following methods for customers to be able to resolve their own issues: 

## Knowledge articles

The Knowledge Article feature is the same as described in the Community Portal.  An organization that provides online customer support benefits by publishing Knowledge Articles on the Portal by;

- Reducing the number of logged cases as customers may find the answers and information in existing Knowledge Articles.
- Allowing customers to find information easily before needed to open a support ticket, provide better customer service and satisfaction.

## Forums

The functionality of Forums operates in the same method as the Community Portal.  Organizations may have their support staff monitor and actively participate in Forums.  Support staff, along with other community members would answer questions and provide information that not only will resolve the particular customers issues but also provide a public archive of the solution for others that may encounter the issue in the future.

## Support cases

The ability to allow for customers to submit support cases operates in the same method as the Community Portal.  This feature is a very common use case for Portals and provide customer service organizations with a key channel to interact with their customers.  A key benefit is that customers wanting to submit a ticket are presented with options to review existing Knowledge Articles and Forum posts, as these items may resolve the customers question in a faster manner.
