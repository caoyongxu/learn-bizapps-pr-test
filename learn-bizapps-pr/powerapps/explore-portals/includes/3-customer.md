The Customer self-service starter portal is for any organization that needs to provide customer support services. Dynamics 365 Customer Service features are extended to the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The Customer self-service portal is only available on Common Data Service environments with Dynamics 365 apps enabled.

Similar to the Community portal, the features for both self-service and assisted service scenarios are included, though the emphasis is on the assisted service scenarios. Some self-service features, such as blogs, are not included.

The Customer self-service portal provides the following methods for customers to resolve their own issues: 

- Knowledge articles
- Forums
- Support cases

## Knowledge articles

The **Knowledge Article** feature is the same as described for the Community portal. An organization that provides online customer support will benefit from publishing knowledge articles on the portal in the following ways:

- Reduction in the number of logged cases because customers might find the answers and information that they need in existing knowledge articles.
- Improved customer service and satisfaction because customers are able to find information before needing to open a support ticket.

## Forums

The **Forums** functionality operates in the same way as the Community portal. Organizations can have their support staff monitor and actively participate in forums. Support staff, along with other community members, would answer questions and provide information that will help resolve the customer's issues and provide a public archive of the solution for others who might encounter the same issue in the future.

## Support cases

The ability to allow customers to submit support cases operates in the same way as the Community portal. This feature is a common use case for portals and provides customer service organizations with a key channel to interact with their customers. A key benefit of support cases is that customers who want to submit a ticket are presented with options to review existing knowledge articles and forum posts because these items might help resolve the customer's question in a faster manner.
