Power Apps portals provide a great way for an external audience to view and interact with data from Dynamics 365 and custom Microsoft Dataverse applications. Portals should be a consideration as a pillar in an organization's overall web strategy. Power Apps portals can be quickly provisioned to serve a variety of different audiences and workloads.

In this module, you looked at various ways to get started using Power Apps portals and features, including:

- How to select a particular audience and workload before provisioning a Power Apps portal. 

- The available portal templates for Dataverse environments, with and without Dynamics 365 enabled.

- How the Community portal provides a platform for an online community where members can interact on a forum, read and contribute to blog postings, search knowledge articles, and submit cases to Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

- How organizations that have customer service departments can be empowered through the Customer self-service portal by publishing knowledge articles online, facilitating a question and answer forum, and if the answer is not available online, the customer can submit a support case that is managed by Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

- How a Human Resources department can provide an Employee self-service portal for internal staff to search policies and procedures, engage with other employees, and submit a case to resolve issues.

- Where organizations with a partner or reseller network can use the Partner portal to allow partners to manage accounts, contacts, and opportunities and to browse published knowledge articles and submit partner support cases.
