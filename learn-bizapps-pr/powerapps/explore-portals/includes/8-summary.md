Power Apps portals provide a great way to allow an external audience to view and interact with data from Dynamics 365 and custom Common Data Service applications.  Portals should be a consideration as a pillar in an organization's overall web strategy.  Power Apps portals can be quickly provisioned to serve a variety of different audiences and workloads.

In this module, we looked at various ways to get started using Power Apps portals and features, including:

- How to select a particular audience and workload before provisioning a Power Apps portal  

- The available portal templates for Common Data Service environments with and without Dynamics 365 enabled

- How the Community Portal provides a platform for an online community where members can interact on a forum, read and contribute to blog postings, search knowledge articles and submit cases to Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

- How organizations that have customer service departments can be empowered via the Customer Self Service Portal by publishing Knowledge Articles online, facilitating a question and answer forum, and finally if the answer is not available online the customer can submit a support case that is managed by Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

- How a Human Resources department can provide Employee Self-Service Portal for internal staff to search policies and procedures, engage with other employees and submit a case to resolve issues.

- Where Organizations with a Partner or Reseller network can use the Partner Portal to allow partners to manage accounts, contacts and opportunities as well as browse published knowledge articles and submit partner support cases.

- That the Custom Portal and Portal from blank provides an option to extend unique line of business applications to external audiences and provides another key aspect to the Power Platform.
