The **Portal from blank** template provides organizations with a basic portal that does not fit the requirements of the specific portal audience or workload features.

This portal is an ideal starting point for unique line-of-business applications with portal requirements. Examples of custom portals could be event and registration management, grant management, or government citizen service solutions. Any custom business app that is built on Microsoft Dataverse can be extended to an external-facing audience.

The Custom portal contains core features such as content management, security, ability to transact with Dataverse, and extensibility.

>[!NOTE]
>The blank portal will appear different if provisioned in a Dataverse environment with Dynamics 365 apps enabled versus one without Dynamics 365 apps.

| Environment with Dynamics 365 apps                           | Dataverse environment without Dynamics 365 apps                    |

> [!NOTE]
> When **Portal from blank** is provisioned in a Dataverse environment with Dynamics 365 apps enabled, it will include an additional **Contact Us** page that allows anonymous enquiries to be recorded as leads within the Dynamics 365 app. 

A functional consultant can configure the Custom portal to address business requirements by adding web links and custom pages and by surfacing Dataverse records. A Custom portal can be further extended by using entity lists, entity forms, web forms, or custom templates.

Features from other portals can be applied to a Custom portal in an environment with Dynamics 365 apps enabled.
