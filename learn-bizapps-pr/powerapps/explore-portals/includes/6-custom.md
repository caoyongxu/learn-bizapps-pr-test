The Custom Portal provides organizations with a basic portal that does not fit the requirements of the specific starter portal audience or starter portal workload features.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Custom Portal and the Portal from blank are essentially the same portal type.  The Custom Portal is provisioned if Dynamics 365 apps are enabled and the Portal from blank is provisioned on Common Data Service environments without Dynamics 365 apps.  Each portal will have a unique home page but all functions and features are identical.

This portal is an ideal starting point for unique line of business applications with portal requirements.  Examples of custom portals could be event and registration management, grant management and certification management.  Any custom business application built on the Power Platform can be extended to an external facing audience using custom Power Apps portals.

The custom portal contains core features such as content management, security, and extensibility.

A functional consultant can configure the custom portal to address business requirements by adding web links, custom pages as well as surfacing Common Data Service records.  A custom portal can be further extended using Entity Lists, Entity Forms, Web Forms or custom templates.

Features from other starter portals can be applied to the custom portal.
