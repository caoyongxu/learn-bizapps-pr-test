  description: Model-driven app design is an approach that focuses on quickly adding components to your apps, like dashboards, forms, views, and charts. With no code or very little, the apps you make can be simple or very complex. Unlike canvas app development where the designer has complete control over app layout, with model-driven apps much of the layout is determined for you and largely designated by the components you add. In other words, the emphasis is more about viewing your business data quickly and making decisions than on intricate app design.
