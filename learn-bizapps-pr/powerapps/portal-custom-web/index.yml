  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  This module covers what are custom web templates and how they can be built and configured to extend and enhance a Power Apps portal. A portal is provisioned with a series of prebuilt web templates. As makers encounter more complex scenarios, they need to understand how to use Liquid template language to create their own web templates that address project requirements.
