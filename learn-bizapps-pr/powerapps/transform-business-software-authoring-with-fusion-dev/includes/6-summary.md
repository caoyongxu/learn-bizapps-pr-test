Fusion Development is meant to empower both your development and business teams to create better software, faster.

During this module, you met the team at VanArsdel Heating and Air Conditioning and learned how they are forming a Fusion Development Team to increase their tech intensity to solve business problems. Tech intensity involves:

- The adoption of technology
- The capability of individuals to use the technology
- And trust organizations have in deploying the technology

Fusion Development Teams gather professionals from across the company to develop software by empowering Citizen Developers, or business professionals, to create applications that solve unique problems alongside and supported by their Professional Developer peers. Aspects of Fusion Development teams include:

- Citizen and Professional Developers brainstorming creating solutions to business problems from across the company.
- Citizen Developers creating Power Apps that exactly solve their business needs.
- Professional Developers working with and supporting the Citizen Developers with existing and new APIs.
- The Fusion Development Team monitoring apps and APIs to reduce the possibility of duplication of apps and ease the discoverability of APIs.

In future modules, you'll work with Kiana and Maria as Kiana learns what it's like to develop Power Apps from a Professional Developer's background. And you'll create a web API to be consumed within a Power App for the Field Inventory Management system.
