1. Make sure that the correct environment is selected in the environment selector in the upper-right corner.
1. From the **Apps** list, locate your portal app (Type = Portal).

1. Select the **Source Code Editor** (**</>**) icon.

1. Replace the existing paragraph with the following HTML and Liquid code.

   ```twig
   <h2>List of accounts</h2>
   {% entityview logical_name:'account', name:'Active Accounts' %}
   <p>We have {{ entityview.total_records }} accounts.</p>
   <ul>
     {% for account in entityview.records -%}
     <li>{{ account.name }}
       {% if account.telephone1 %}
       (<a href="tel:{{ account.telephone1 }}">{{ account.telephone1 }}</a>)
       {% endif %}
     </li>
     {% endfor %}
   </ul>
   {% endentityview %}
   ```

1. Select **Save**.

   You should see the list of current accounts on the canvas, including hyperlinked telephone numbers where they are present.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![List of accounts appears in Portal Studio](../media/liquid-exercise.png)](../media/liquid-exercise.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Browse website** button. The displayed webpage should only contain the text, "We have 0 accounts."

    > [!NOTE]
    > This result is expected because, at runtime, the portal will deny access to entity records unless an entity permission record exists to allow access to the data.
