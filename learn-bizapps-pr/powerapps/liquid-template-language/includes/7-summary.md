Liquid is integrated natively into Power Apps portals. It adds template processing to Power Apps portals including logic, processing instructions, and Common Data Service access to produce HTML or text output sent to the browser. It can be used to add dynamic content to pages, and to create a wide variety of custom templates. It is proven and it is secure as it only provides access to the data and operations explicitly allowed by the portals.

By now you should be able to:

* Describe what Liquid is and how it is used in portals
* Interpret the syntax of Liquid and understand the basic structure of the Liquid code
* Differentiate Liquid tags, objects and filters

### Next steps

The next step would be to learn how to secure the portal content, both static as well as the dynamics content generated by the entity lists, forms, and Liquid code.
