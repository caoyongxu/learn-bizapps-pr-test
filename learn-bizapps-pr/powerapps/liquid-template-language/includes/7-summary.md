Liquid is integrated natively into Power Apps portals. It adds template processing to Power Apps portals, including logic, processing instructions, and Common Data Service access, to produce HTML or text output that is sent to the browser. Liquid can be used to add dynamic content to pages and to create a variety of custom templates. Additionally, Liquid provides access only to the data and operations that are explicitly allowed by the portals.

By now, you should be able to:

- Describe Liquid template language and how it's used in portals.
- Interpret the syntax of Liquid and understand the basic structure of Liquid code.
- Differentiate Liquid tags, objects, and filters.

### Next steps

Your next step would be to learn how to secure portal content, both static and dynamic, that is generated by the entity lists, forms, and Liquid code.
