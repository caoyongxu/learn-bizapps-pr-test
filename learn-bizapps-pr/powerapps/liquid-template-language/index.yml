 title: Work with the Liquid template language in Power Apps portals 
 description: Liquid is an [open-source template language](http://dotliquidmarkup.org/?azure-portal=true) integrated natively into Power Apps portals. It basically acts as a bridge between the Common Data Service and the HTML or text output sent to the browser. It can be used to add dynamic content to pages, and to create a wide variety of custom templates. It is proven and it is secure as it only provides access to the data and operations explicitly allowed by the portals.
