Tables and their associated records are a large part of many apps. In
this module, you learned more about the specifics of what constitutes a
table and a record. With that knowledge secured you then explored the
different types of functions that you can use to query, modify, and update
records inside of tables. Some of the important concepts to remember
include:

-   Inside your app, you can generate tables to use with specific
    controls or functions using both the **Table** function and the [ ] syntax depending on your needs.

-   If you need a table to use throughout your app, you can generate a
    **Collection** variable to store records in a table.

-   To retrieve data from tables, you can use the **Filter** function to
    return a table of the records or the **LookUp** function to return a
    single record.
