Welcome to Microsoft PowerApps. This self-paced online module helps you build apps from the ground up. You'll learn how to easily create an app from data in a Microsoft Excel workbook that's stored on Microsoft OneDrive for Business. And you'll be able to do this without having to use a traditional programming language like C#.

With PowerApps, you can:

- Quickly build an app by using the skills you already have. 
- Connect to the cloud services and data sources you're already using.
- Instantly share your apps so that co-workers across the company or across the world can use them on their phones and tablets.

The sky's the limit when it comes to using PowerApps to get things done and keep people informed. Here are just a few examples to get you thinking about how you can use an app, instead of traditional paper notes, to run your business:

- **Equipment in the field**: Often, company representatives who visit customers in the field carry clipboards to help guarantee a paper trail of parts with scheduled replacement dates. By using a tablet and a PowerApps app for parts, reps can look up the customer's equipment, see a picture of a part, test and analyze the part, and then order new partsâ€”all without having to leave the customer's warehouse as they might have done in the past.
- **Restaurant employee management**: Employees of a large restaurant used to have to fill out work schedules and vacation requests on sheets of paper stapled to a back wall. With PowerApps running on everyone's smartphone, employees now just open the app to record the same information, anywhere, any time. There are even built-in reminders for the start of the next day's shift.

If you're a beginner with PowerApps, this module gets you going quickly. If you're familiar with PowerApps, it ties concepts together and fills in the gaps.

### PowerApps building blocks
PowerApps is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to let you do much more than just view your data.

You can now act on your data and update it anywhere and on any device.

To create, share, and administer apps, you'll typically need to visit four places in the following order:

1. **<web.powerapps.com>**: You'll use this site to start creating apps based on sample apps and templates.
1. **PowerApps Studio**: This is where you'll create apps based on the data connections they require.
1. **PowerApps Mobile**: You can run your apps in PowerApps Mobile, which is available for Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, and Google Android devices.
1.  **PowerApps admin center**: This is where you'll define environments for your apps, and manage data connections and other elements. 

When you're done with all that, you can just run your apps in a browser from Microsoft Dynamics 365. You can also run them in PowerApps Mobile, which is available for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

Now that you have an overview of this module, what PowerApps is, and what its main parts are, we'll look more closely at PowerApps components.
