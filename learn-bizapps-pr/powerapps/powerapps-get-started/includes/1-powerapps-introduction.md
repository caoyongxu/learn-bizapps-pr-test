Welcome to Microsoft PowerApps. This self-paced online module helps you build apps from the ground up.

With this introductory module, you'll learn how to easily create an app from data in a Microsoft Excel workbook that's stored on Microsoft OneDrive for Business. And you'll be able to do this without having to use a traditional programming language such as C#.

With PowerApps, you can:

- Quickly build an app by using the skills that you already have.
- Connect to the cloud services and data sources that you're already using.
- Instantly share your apps so that co-workers across the company or across the world can use them on their phones and tablets.

The sky's the limit when it comes to using PowerApps to get things done and keep people informed. Here are just a few examples to get you thinking about how you can use an app, instead of traditional paper notes, to run your business:

- **Equipment in the field**: Often, company representatives who visit customers in the field carry clipboards to help guarantee a paper trail of parts with scheduled replacement dates. By running an app on a tablet, reps can look up the customer's equipment, see a picture of a part, test and analyze the part, and then order new parts â€” all without having to leave the customer's warehouse as reps might have done before.
- **Restaurant employee management**: Employees of a large restaurant used to have to fill out work schedules and vacation requests on sheets of paper stapled to a back wall. With PowerApps running on everyone's smartphone, employees now just open the app to record the same information, anywhere, any time. The app can even send reminders for the start of the next day's shift.

If you're a beginner with PowerApps, this module gets you going quickly. If you're familiar with PowerApps, it ties concepts together and fills in the gaps.

## PowerApps building blocks
PowerApps is a collection of services, apps, and connectors that work together to let you do much more than just view your data. You can act on your data and update it anywhere and on any device.

To create, share, and administer apps, you'll use these sites:

1. [web.powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com) In this site, you can open apps, specify the type of app that you want to create, create data connections and flows, and manage entities in Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps.
1. **PowerApps Studio**: In this site, you build apps by configuring UI elements and Excel-like formulas.
1. **PowerApps admin center**: In this site, you'll define environments, databases in CDS for Apps, and data policies.

When you're done with all that, you can run your apps in a browser (from Microsoft Dynamics 365) or in PowerApps Mobile (available for Windows tablets, iOS devices, and Android devices).

Now that you have an overview of this module, what PowerApps is, and what its main parts are, we'll look more closely at PowerApps components.
