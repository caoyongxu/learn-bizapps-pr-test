## Related technologies
Microsoft PowerApps works with other technologies to help you build and share apps across your organization and in the field. Let's take a look at some of these technologies:

- **Microsoft Dynamics 365**: Dynamics 365 is the home for all your business apps: Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft Flow, Dynamics 365 for Talent, and many others.
- **Microsoft AppSource**: AppSource is where you share apps and download other apps that might be useful to your business.
- **Data sources**: Without data, you don't have a business. Data sources bring cloud and on-premises data into your apps. They are accessed by using connections, connectors, and gateways.

### Dynamics 365
Dynamics 365 is a cloud service with apps that help you address specific business needs, such as sales automation, operations, or customer service.

The advantage of having the apps in Dynamics 365 is that you have one place to run all your business apps, whether they come from app builders in your organization, from Microsoft, or from third parties.

### AppSource
AppSource is the place to find and evaluate apps from your colleagues, from Microsoft, and from our partners. In PowerApps, you share apps to AppSource. Users can then view and run those apps in Dynamics 365, and also on mobile devices or the web. You can choose to make your apps available to the public or just to people in your organization.

### Data sources, connections, connectors, and gateways
PowerApps apps use many data sources, and connectors are used to make connections to those data sources. Some of the most popular data sources are shown here.

Many data sources are cloud services, like Salesforce. Even Twitter can be a data source if you're tracking your company's hashtags. Connectors might not feel like the coolest part of app development, but they're essential when you work with data that you, your colleagues, and your customers care about. And when an app lights up with your data source for the first time, you'll suddenly find that they're very cool!

For data that's stored on-premises instead of in the cloud, you use a gateway to provide a reliable connection between PowerApps and your data source. The gateway sits on an on-premises computer and communicates with PowerApps.

You now know a little more about all the parts of PowerApps and related technologies. As you go through this module, you'll continue to deepen your knowledge about each part.
