Shaping the data provided from the data source is an important way to
improve the usability and performance of your app.  Many apps do not
need users to view all the records in a data source.  In this
module, you learned how to shape the data using filters and operators. You also
learned about the **Search** function and functions that only modify table columns in
PowerApps. These items are important to remember:

-   Use the **Filter** function to return only the data that matches the
    criteria defined in the formula.

-   Use **And, Or**, and other operators to create more complex
    filters.

-   The **Search** function allows you to use a query against a string
    column and return only records that match the string.  The string
    can be found anywhere within the column.

-   **AddColumns**, **DropColumns**, **RenameColumns**, **ShowColumns**
    functions allow you to modify the columns of a table only within
    PowerApps.  The original data source columns will not be modified.

In the next module, you'll focus on how to work with forms and write
data by using the **Submit** function.
