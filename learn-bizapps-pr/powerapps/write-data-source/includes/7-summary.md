Remember when building apps, rarely is the first release or rollout flawless. As an app builder you can do all the testing you want, but end-user testing and adoption of the app is crucial to its success.

App builders and end users may think about using the app in different scenarios that you didn't account for. Or maybe there was training on how to use the app in a particular order, but the end users are using it differently.

In the next, and final module within this learning path, you'll learn about publishing, sharing, and maintaining your app. With the app logic and functionality nearly complete, it's time to get the app into some user's hands so they can test and provide feedback.
