When you are building apps, remember that the first release or rollout is rarely flawless. As an app builder, you can do all the testing that you want, but end-user testing and adoption of the app is crucial to its success.

App builders and users might consider using the app in different scenarios that you didn't expect. Alternatively, perhaps a training occurred on how to use the app in a particular order, but people are using it differently.

In the final module within this learning path, you'll learn about publishing, sharing, and maintaining your app. With the app logic and functionality nearly complete, it's time to get the app into some user's hands so that they can test and provide feedback.
