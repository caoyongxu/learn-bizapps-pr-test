In this learning path, you've learned about building canvas apps from Microsoft Power Apps, including how to:

- Create and implement a data model.

- Create an app.

- Add controls.

- Filter and display your data.
 
> [!NOTE]
> If you didn't complete the previous modules, you can download the [packaging files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/tree/master/power-apps/expense%20report%20app%20-%20module%205). The files contain the completed work on the Travel Expense Report app thus far.

However, you still need to write data back to the data source. In this module you'll build out the last screen, **Scr_EditExpense**, which will be used to create new expenses and edit existing expenses.
