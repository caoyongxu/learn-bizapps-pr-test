  - content: You are creating a solution for a not-for-profit system. You need to move quickly with the build. What should you use?
    choices: 
    - content: Proof of concept
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: PoCs are used to validate data models and designs. They do not get you started quickly.
    - content: Nonprofit industry accelerator
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Accelerators enable you to quickly build industry vertical solutions because the data schema has already been defined.
    - content: Create custom tables
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Creating you own custom tables will take time to design and validate the data model. You should use an accelerator if one is available.
    - content: XrmToolBox
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The XrmToolBox is a set of community tools that allow easier customization and administration. XrmToolBox will document your data model but will not create it for you.
  - content: Which data type should you use to create a column that has three values that the user must select from and the values change every three months?
    choices: 
    - content: Yes/No
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Yes/No columns are Boolean and only hold either a zero (0) or a one (1) value. 
    - content: Choice
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Choice columns don't allow items to be deleted from the choice list and require a customizer to make the changes.
    - content: Lookup
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A lookup column is linked to a table. Users can select from the active rows on this table with a lookup control. The rows in the table can be deactivated by a user with privileges.
    - content: Text
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Test fields allow any value to be entered. They do not permit a range of values to select from.
