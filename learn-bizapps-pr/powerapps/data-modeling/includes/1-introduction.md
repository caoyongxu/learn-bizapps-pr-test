The Solution Architect is responsible for the overall high-level design of the data model for the solution. Understanding the capabilities of Dataverse is imperative when designing the data model for the solution. This module addresses the trade offs for modeling data in Power Platform solutions.

## What is data modeling?

A data model is a visual model showing how data flows through your system and how different entities relate to each other. Data models define the relationship types between entities and abstract a database to a visual representation that is easy to understand.

For solutions based on the Power Platform, the data model is crucial to the design of the solution as it will affect app design, especially model-driven apps.

## Solution Architectâ€™s role in data modeling

The solution architect:

- Leads the data model design effort to establish a high-level data architecture for the project.
- Establishes a data model that can be extended by the individual design teams and communicate the design with the teams.
- Reviews and provides feedback as the data model evolves during detail design of solution features.

## Do not always have all the information

Data modeling can be hard and experience of many different projects will increase your data modeling skills. There is often not a clear correct answer and there may be many possible options.

A solution architect has to make the best choices with the limited information available, this is part of being a solution architect.
