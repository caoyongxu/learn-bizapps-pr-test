An important element to understand in your app development is forms.
Forms allow you to view, edit, and create new records in your data
source. In this module, you focused on the different form modes, how to
customize a form, and how to submit data and special properties for working
with forms. These items are important to remember:

-   Use the **Edit Form** control if you want to view or edit an
    existing item or add a new item. If you only want to view an item the
    **Display Form** control can be used, although it has less
    customization options.

-   You must specify the record that you want to return in the form control.
    The two most common ways of returning a record are by connecting the
    **Form** control to a **Gallery** control's selected property or by using a
    **LookUp** function.

-   Based on the outcome of the submission, use the **OnSuccess**,
    **OnFailure**, and **OnReset** properties to run formulas after
    submission.
