Welcome to Microsoft PowerApps. This self-paced online course helps you build apps from the ground up. You will learn how to easily create a app from data in an Excel spreadsheet that lives on OneDrive for Business.  And you'll be able to this without touching a traditional programming language such as C#.

With PowerApps, you can:

- Build a an app quickly from the skills you already have. 
- Connect to the cloud services and data sources you're already using.
- Share your apps instantly with co-workers across the company or across the world on their phones and tablets.

The sky's the limit when comes to the use of PowerApps to get things done and people informed. Here are only a few examples that might make you think of an app rather than the usual paper notes to help run your business:

- **Equipment in the field**: Often company representatives visit customers in the field with clipboards securing a paper trail of parts with scheduled replacement dates. With a tablet and PowerApps for parts, this same rep can look up the customer's equipment, see a picture of a part, test and analyze the part, then order new parts—Without leaving the customer's warehouse as he might have done in the past.
- **Restaurant employee management**: A large restaurant used to have its employees fill out their work schedules and vacation requests on a back wall stapled with reams of paper. With PowerApps running on everyone's smartphone, employees now just open the app to record the same information, anywhere, any time—with reminders even built in for the start of the next day's shift.

If you're a beginner with PowerApps this course gets you going quick. If you're familiar with PowerApps this course ties concepts together, and fills in the gaps.

## PowerApps building blocks
PowerApps is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to not just view your data.

Now you can act on your data as well as update it anywhere and on any device.

To create, share, and administer apps, you'll typically need to visit four places in the following order:

1. **<Web.powerapps.com>**: You'll use this site to begin to create apps using sample apps and templates.
1. **PowerApps Studio**: This is where your apps are created using the data connections your app requires.
1. **PowerApps Mobile**: You can run your apps within PowerApps Mobile, which is available for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.
1.  **PowerApps admin center**: Here, you'll define environments for your apps, manage data connections, and other elements. 

And when you're done with all that, you can simply run your apps in a browser from Microsoft Dynamics 365. You can also run them by using PowerApps Mobile, which is available for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.
