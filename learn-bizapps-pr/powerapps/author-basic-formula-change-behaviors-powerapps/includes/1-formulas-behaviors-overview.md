When using formulas, you have the ability to change the way controls
respond and function. For example, in certain scenarios, you can
hide a control on the screen until another action has taken place. This
is done by writing a simple formula to update the **Visible** property
of the control. Or maybe instead of hiding the control, you set the
**DisplayMode** property to **View** which removes the ability to edit
that control. There are many more scenarios where this type of formula
can be implemented in a canvas app. By effectively utilizing these
formulas in your canvas app to modify the **DisplayMode** and or
**Visible** properties of a control, you can develop a more
user-friendly app.
