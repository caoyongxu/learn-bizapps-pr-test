Formulas enhance functionality, performance, and user experience in your
Power Apps canvas app. In this module, you learned how to use formulas to
modify control functionality and enhance your app. Some important items to
remember are:

-   You can use true and false directly in a property or formula but,
    you can also replace them with an equation that resolves to true and
    false.

-   The **Not** function returns the opposite of true or false.

-   **DisplayMode** can control both the visual aspects of a control and
    their interactivity.

The next module will focus on writing formulas that interact with tables
of data.
