Power Apps portals come with a variety of preconfigured portal solutions that target diverse audiences. Starter portals have many features that add value to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 service apps. The following sections explain how these features help modern businesses engage a modern audience.

## Modern audience

People have various experiences with customer service support, both positive and negative. Frequently, customer service support experiences involve being put on hold for a long time and waiting for a customer service agent to answer the call. Another negative experience might involve writing a letter, mailing it, and waiting without any expectation of a reply. Customer service support experiences should be positive and convenient. Rather than being put on hold, most people would prefer to use self-service capabilities on the company's website, where their issue will be sent directly to the supplier's knowledge base for the products and services. Similarly, instead of writing a letter, people can engage in the online community forum and get instantaneous answers from other users who are sharing their related experiences.

Portal capabilities empower the majority of online consumers who prefer to find answers on their own through self-service and community options. By using Power Apps portals, you can provide them with a branded, personalized, self-service experience. Portals help you provide an organized, searchable knowledge base to deliver consistent, up-to-date answers and community experience for peer-to-peer support and direct interaction with your subject matter experts. Additionally, portals provide simple navigation with seamless transitions between self and assisted support.

Out-of-the-box mobile optimizations for portal and knowledge articles ensure that customers can get the help that they need, any time and from any device. 

Consumers are a major driver of this trend:

- The majority of global consumers now expect brands and organizations to offer a self-service portal. 

- Nearly one-third of consumers keep in touch with brands they've done business with to make sure that they are getting the most out of their purchase. 

- Half of the consumers are using multiple channels to stay connected, including web, mobile, telephone, social, and self-service channels. Often, consumer use many channels for a single support experience.

Providing a web portal interface takes advantage of these user trends and brings any type of engagement, including partner, group, and employee scenarios, that directly accesses Common Data Service to create a modern connected experience for external users and internal business operations.

## Modern business

Your business is already using Power Apps. Consider the additional capabilities that using Power Apps portals can deliver: 

- **Provide self-service support** - When your business is growing, rather than having to employ extra staff in call centers, you could use Power Apps portals to add self-service capabilities to your website so that your customers can search knowledge articles, engage with other customers, find answers, and create support cases when needed (that go directly into Dynamics 365 Customer Service), all without a single interaction from your resources.

- **Build a sales pipeline** - When a lead fills out a **Contact us** form on your company website, this information is recorded in Dynamics 365 Sales where the record can become part of your sales pipeline automatically.

- **Empower employees** - When an employee needs a new computer, they can fill out an online form, where the information will be recorded in Common Data Service so the helpdesk staff can immediately access and process this information.

- **Engage mobile workforce** - Empower agents on any device, wherever they work. Field technicians can process and complete work orders in the field, instantly updating Dynamics 365 Field Service.
