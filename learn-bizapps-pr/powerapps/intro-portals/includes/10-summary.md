Power Apps portals extends Common Data Service access to external parties like customers, employees, or partners. This allows for businesses to extend and scale their operations as they reduce call center costs, manual processing, resolution times while at the same time improving end-user satisfaction, transparency, and scale of operations.

Let's have a quick look at what we have covered in this module:

* We reviewed business scenarios where Power Apps portals can add value to both customer Power Platform and Dynamics 365 solutions.
* We looked at some core records for the content and data access: web pages, templates, entity forms and entity lists. 
* We discussed the fundamentals of portals security and what methods are used to control access to the content and data.

## Next steps

In the next module, you will learn about individual features included in each of the available portal template and how to add new features to already provisioned portal.
