# Review
Congratulations on building your first flow! 

Let's do a quick review of what you learned so far.

- You created a simple flow that saves email attachments to your OneDrive for Business account.
- You created a more complicated flow using a SharePoint list that allows a company's employees to suggest tweets. When the tweet is approved, it is automatically posted to the company's Tweeter account.
- You learned that there are many templates to help you create even more flows to help connect up your vital services easily.

And you probably did all this quickly. Outstanding!

The easiest way to advance your skills is to run the samples, play around with the templates, and generate more flows.

## What's Next?
Regardless of how much experience you began with, we hope you now have a very clear picture of what flows are and how you can start creating new ones.
