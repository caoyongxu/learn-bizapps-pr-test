Most of the design, layout, and adding specific components can be easily done using point and click methods in the portal studio. However, there are instances where you may need to fine tune specific components or add custom HTML, JavaScript, CSS or Liquid to a particular page or section of a web page.

In the portal studio canvas, you can select a specific section and click on the </> in the footer to expand the Code Editor. This will display the source code of the specific web page.  You can edit or add custom code to through this editor.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can potentially damage the layout of your page by entering incorrect syntax in the source code.
