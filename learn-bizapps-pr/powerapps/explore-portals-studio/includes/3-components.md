Once a web page is created, a portal maker can add a set of predefined components on the page to format the layout as well as surface both static and dynamic content.

This simple design approach will actually add corresponding HTML, CSS, or Liquid code to the web page without the maker needing to know the structure or syntax of these languages. This configuration information will be stored on the page copy field of the content web page record.

Select the component from the toolbelt to add it to the web page canvas. Depending on the component type, either enter the content directly on the canvas (for example, text) or configure the component via the properties pane.
