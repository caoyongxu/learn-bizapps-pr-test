Another way to make your App more dynamic and intuitive to the user is
to use the **IsBlank**, **IsBlankOrError**, **IsEmpty**, **IsNumeric**, **IsToday**, and
**IsMatch** functions. These functions allow for validation of the
condition of a field, control, variable, or table. All these functions
return true or false based on the results of their evaluation. This can
allow for the creation of solutions where you don't allow the user to
submit a form if a field is blank or if the field's data doesn't match
the evaluation. The following is an overview of each function.

-   **IsBlank** -- This function checks a field, property, or variable
    to see if the result is blank. If the object is blank, then the
    function returns true.

-   **IsBlankOrError** -- This function checks whether an expression is blank or results in an error, and returns true or false.

-   **IsEmpty** -- This function checks a table of data to see if it
    contains records. If the table is empty, then the function returns
    true.

-   **IsMatch** -- This function checks a field, property, or variable
    to determine if the result matches the specified pattern. If the pattern is
    a match the function returns true. For details about the various matching patterns, see
    [IsMatch function in Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-ismatch).

-   **IsNumeric** -- This function checks a field, property, or variable
    to determine if the result is numeric. If the object is numeric, then the
    function returns true.

-   **IsToday** -- This function checks if a date or time value is
    between midnight today and midnight tomorrow. If the date or time
    value is within that range, the function returns true.

Use the following example to disable a button if the **Text Input**
control is not a valid email address.

1.  Add a **Text Input** control to the canvas.

2.  Add a **Button** control to the canvas.

3.  Modify the **DisplayMode** property of the **Button** control to the
    following formula.
```powerappsfl
If(IsMatch(TextInput1.Text, Email), DisplayMode.Edit,DisplayMode.Disabled)
```

4.  Preview the app by selecting the **Play** button in the upper-right corner.

5.  If the field is blank or has an incomplete email address, the button
    will be disabled and display in a grey color. When you enter a valid
    formatted email address, the button will turn to blue.
