Formulas enhance functionality, performance, and user experience in your
Power Apps canvas app. In this module, you learned about
formulas, how to modify control properties using formulas, how to use
formulas to do calculations, and how to use conditional formatting in
your app. Some important items to remember are:

-   Conditional formatting can be used to change the color of text based
    on values, show or hide fields, or even disable fields based on a
    condition. It is a great way to enhance the usability of your app.

-   Use the calculation functions within your app to do aggregate
    functions and return values. This allows you to complete
    calculations in the app without needing to use another tool.

-   Each control type has a unique set of properties. Use these
    properties to modify the functionality and format of controls.

-   Use the validation functions (**IsBlank**, **IsBlankOrError**, **IsEmpty**,
    **IsNumeric**, **IsToday**, and **IsMatch**) to prevent errors and
    prevent slowdowns in the processing of the data.

The next module will focus on how to use basic formulas to make behavior
changes to enhance your app.
