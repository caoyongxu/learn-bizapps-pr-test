At the beginning of the module, you learned what controls are, when to use them, and how to modify control properties. In this section, you get a more detailed look into some of the controls available from the Controls drop-down menu in the ribbon. On the **Insert** tab, if you select the **Input** heading, you will get a list of several different controls.

Remember, every control was designed with different use cases in mind. The following information about a few of the controls will help you to decide when you might use each one.

Controls with pre-populated values
----------------------------------

Each of these controls allows you to determine the values the user can
select from. Use these controls when you want to control the values for
your data set. This is often an important consideration for reporting.
As a trade-off, you may miss valuable insights that come from free form
answers. Here's a closer look at the differences between each of these controls.

-   **Drop down** - This control conserves screen real estate,
    especially when the list contains a large number of choices. The
    control takes up only one line unless the user selects the chevron
    to reveal more choices. This control will show a maximum of 500
    items.

-   **Combo box** - This control allows you to search for items
    you will select. The search is performed on the server on the
    **SearchField** property so performance is not affected by very large
    data sources.

-   **List box** - This control always shows all available choices
    (unlike
    a [Dropdown](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-drop-down/?azure-portal=true) control)
    and in which the user can choose more than one item at a time
    (unlike a
    [Radio](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-radi/?azure-portal=trueo) control).

-   **Check box** - A control that the user can select or clear to set
    its value to **true** or **false**. The user can specify a Boolean
    value by using this familiar control.

-   **Radio** - A **Radio** control, a standard HTML input control, is
    best used with only a few, mutually-exclusive options.

Controls for ratings
--------------------

When you have a specific need for the app users to rate items, the
following two controls provide a better experience than free form text
or drop-down controls.

-   **Slider** - The user can indicate a value, between a minimum and a
    maximum value that you specify, by dragging the handle of a slider
    left-right or up-down, depending on the direction that you choose.

-   **Rating** - In this control, the user can indicate, for example, how
    much they liked something by selecting a certain number of stars.

Other available controls
------------------------

-   **Toggle** - Use this control to enhance the UI of the app. It
    functions in the same manner as the check box control.

-   **Timer** - A control that can determine how your app responds after
    a certain amount of time passes. For example, determine how long a
    control appears or navigate to another screen after a certain amount
    of time has passed.

-   **Date Picker** - A control that allows you to select a Date from a calendar.

-   **Button** - Configure the **OnSelect** property of a button control to
    run one or more formulas when the user clicks or taps the control.
    The button control is frequently used to submit data to the data
    source.
