In this module, you learned more about controls and how you can incorporate them into your app. You also learned about the properties of controls and how you can modify them to enhance the functionality of your app. Depending on the app that you're developing, you can use several different controls, or you can only use a few specific ones. Here are a few important points to remember:

-   There are many control options for placing text on a screen or
    allowing a user to enter text.

-   Use the pre-populated value controls to provide choices for the
    user.

-   By adding media controls directly to your app, you can enhance the
    functionality and reduce the number of steps for your user. For
    example, users can enter their expenses and upload their receipts
    without leaving the app.
