Controls are one of the biggest components of a Power App because implementation determines how your app interacts with your data, what actions are available to a user, and what conditions may need to be met before another action can be taken. You can configure the appearance and behavior of a control by setting one of its properties. Because controls are designed with specific use cases in mind, the properties for each control are slightly different. Here are some important properties to be aware of:

-   **Default** - The initial value of a control before it is changed by
    the user. For example, when working with a Drop down control you
    could set the default value to appear when users see the control.

-   **DelayOutput** - Set to true to delay action during text input.

-   **DisplayMode** - Values can be **Edit, View,** or **Disabled**.
    Configures whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only
    displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**). For more information about display modes, see Use basic formulas
    to make better canvas apps in Power Apps learning path.

-   **Items** - The source of data that appears in a control such as a
    gallery, list, or chart.

-   **OnChange** - How the app responds when the user changes the value
    of a control. For example, when a user selects a different value in
    a Dropdown control.

-   **OnSelect** - How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a
    control.

-   **Reset** - Whether a control reverts to its default value. For more information, see [Reset function in Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-reset).

-   **Text** - Text that appears on a control or that the user types into
    a control.

-   **Tooltip** - Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over
    a control.

-   **Visible** - Whether a control appears or is hidden.
