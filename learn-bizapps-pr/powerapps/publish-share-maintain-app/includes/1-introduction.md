You've put a lot of effort into planning and building your app, but you're still not at the end of your journey. No app is done after the first build and may never be complete. Instead, consider app building as a cycle rather than a race with a clear beginning and end. You have nearly completed a full rotation of the cycle, but testing, refining, and changing requirements will push your development through to additional cycles. Ensure that you still take the time to plan and design with each new iteration of your app.

As you can see, the remaining phase in the cycle is Deploy and Refine.

Let's walk through how to do these and discuss some of the practical aspects of maintaining your canvas app.
