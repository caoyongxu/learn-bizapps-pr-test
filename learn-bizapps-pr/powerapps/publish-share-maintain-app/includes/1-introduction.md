You've put considerable effort into planning and building your app, but you're still not at the end of your journey. Apps aren't complete after the first build, and they might never be considered complete. Consider app building as a cycle, with a clear beginning and end. You have nearly completed a full rotation of the cycle, but testing, refining, and changing requirements will push your development through to other cycles. Ensure that you still take time to plan and design for each new iteration of your app.

As shown in the preceding image, the remaining phase in the cycle is **Deploy and Refine**.

This module explains how you can complete this phase and describes some practical aspects of maintaining your canvas app.
