Even the most proficient, experienced app builders can make mistakes when developing apps. But what's important to understand is how to undo a premature release of your app or revert to a previous version if bugs occur. Let's take a look at how you could revert your app to a previous version, if necessary:

1. Navigate toÂ [http://make.powerapps.com](http://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true). You should see your app listed at the bottom of the screen, but if you don't, select **Apps** in the navigation menu.

1. Find your app and select the ellipses "**...**" beside it, but this time, select **Details**.

    > [![Screenshot of the Apps menu with the Travel Expense Report selected and the ellipses and Details options highlighted again.](../media/report-details.png)](../media/report-details.png#lightbox)

    On the App **Details** screen, you can see some basic information about your app including the Name, Web link, and license designation. Across the top, you can navigate to see other information such as the Connections and Power Automate Flows used in your app and basic usage Analytics.

1. Select **Versions**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot of the Versions tab of the Travel Expense Report app.](../media/versions.png)](../media/versions.png#lightbox)

    You can see all the versions of your app ever created as well as any notes you included when saving. The most recently published version has "**Live**" in the Published column. You can restore or delete any version created in the last six months. Note that when restoring a previous version, this will not move the version up, but instead create a new version, which you can then go in to publish. In the image below, version 6 would stay the same, but a new version, version 8, would be created as a copy of version 6.
