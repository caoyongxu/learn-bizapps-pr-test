In this module, we have gone over the process of creating a business process flow and attaching it to the model-driven app we created in the prior module. We learned that a business process flow helps app users navigate the data entering process in stages. We also saw how a business process flow stores data in a Dataverse table. We used the data in the business process flow table as a mean to notify a person when a new accident has been recorded and approved using Power Automate flows. Both types of flows can give the app user a better usage experience and automate some tasks.
