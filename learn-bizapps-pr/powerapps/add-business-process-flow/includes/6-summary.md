In this module, you have learned about the process of creating a business process flow and how to attach it to the model-driven app that you created in the previous module. You learned that a business process flow helps app users navigate the data-entering process in stages. Additionally, you discovered how a business process flow stores data in a Dataverse table. You used the data in the business process flow table as a way to notify a person when a new accident has been recorded and approved by using Power Automate flows. Both types of flows can give the app user a better usage experience, and both help to automate certain tasks.
