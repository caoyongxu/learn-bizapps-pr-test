While Power Apps offer hundreds of connectors to connect to Microsoft and non-Microsoft services, you may want to communicate with services that are not available as prebuilt connectors like Inventory Management. Custom connectors address this scenario by allowing you to create a connector with its own actions.

* As a professional developer, you can create a custom connector from API Management by exporting the APIs.
* As a citizen developer, as long as you have an Open API document, you can create a custom connector within Power Apps by importing the Open API document.

To review, this module has covered the following topics:

* To create a custom connector from Azure API Management by exporting the APIs,
* To create a custom connector from the Open API document by importing it,
* To know the differences between a connector and a connection,
* To create a connection of the custom connector by providing authentication details,
* To test the custom connector by using the existing connection details.
* To add the custom connector to Power App, and
* To call an API through the custom connector.
