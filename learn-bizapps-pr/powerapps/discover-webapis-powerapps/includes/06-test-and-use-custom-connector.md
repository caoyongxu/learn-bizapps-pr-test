Once you have created a custom connector from either Azure API Management or an OpenAPI document, you need to test to make sure it runs as expected, and then use it in in a Power Apps Canvas app.

## Testing Custom Connector ##

The last step of creating a custom connector is to check whether it works as expected. Power Apps Studio gives you the ability to test your connector. You can see the functionality in the screenshot below.

During this testing stage, you can test the connection and the API operations. Here are test results of the custom connector.

Once you complete the test, you are now good to go build a Power Apps app with the custom connector.
