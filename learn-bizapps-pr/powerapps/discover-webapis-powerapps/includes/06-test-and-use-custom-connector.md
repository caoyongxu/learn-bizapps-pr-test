Once you have got a custom connector either from Azure API Management or OpenAPI document, you need to make sure whether it runs as expected, and use it within the Power Apps Canvas.


## Testing Custom Connector ##

The last step of creating a custom connector is to check whether it works as expected.

During this testing stage, you can test the connection and the API operations.


## Using Custom Connector in Power Apps Canvas ##

Once you complete the test, you are now good to go build a Power App with the custom connector.

Then the custom connector works as like a function in the Power App.

In the next couple of units, you will exercise how to test the custom connector and use it within the Power App canvas.


## Key Takeaways ##

After this unit, you are now able to:

* Understand why you need to test a custom connector, and
* Understand how the custom connector appears within a Power App canvas.
