Maria now has a custom connector for a web API to use in her Power App application. But before she can use it, she needs to test it to make sure it runs as expected.


## Testing the custom Connector ##

The last step of creating a custom connector is to check whether it works as expected. Power Apps Studio gives you the ability to test your connector. You can see the functionality in the screenshot below.

During this testing stage, you can test the connection and the API operations. Here are example test results, both passing and failing, of the custom connector.

Once you complete the test, you are now good to go build a Power Apps app with the custom connector.
