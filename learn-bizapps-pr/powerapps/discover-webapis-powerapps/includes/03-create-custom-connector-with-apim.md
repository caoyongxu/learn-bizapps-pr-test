Maria needs to display warehouse locations in her Power Apps app. Crystal and her development team have built several web APIs to support inventory management, one of which returns the warehouse locations.

The web APIs are served through [Azure API Management][az apim], which has the ability to create custom connectors for any web APIs it hosts. With the custom connector, Maria's Power Apps app will be able to call the warehouse location API in Azure API Management.

## Export Custom Connector from API Management ##

Here are the inventory management API details hosted by API Management.

1. In order to access API Management from Power Apps, you should have a subscription key. Go to the `Subscriptions` blade, click the three dots (`...`) and select the `Show/hide keys` menu.

1. Then, copy the subscription key from either `Primary key` or `Secondary key`.

1. To generate a custom connector from Azure API Management, go to the `APIs` blade and select an appropriate API under the `All APIs` section. In the screenshot, it's **Inventory Management**. Then, you will be able to see the API for the warehouse locations.

1. Choose your Power Apps environment for the custom connector to publish and give the display name, **InventoryManager**. Then click the `Export` button at the bottom.

The inventory management APIs have been exported to Power Apps.


## Create Connection to Custom Connector ##

Although you created the custom connector, in order to use it, you should create a connection to the custom connector. Generally speaking, creating the connection requires authentication to the APIs.

After logging into [Power Apps][pa] dashboard, open the `Data` blade and click the `Custom Connectors` menu on the left-hand side. Then, click the `‚ûï` button on the right-hand side.

> **NOTE**:
> 
> The following part is based on the current bug of the custom connector created from API Management. We should update this part once this bug is fixed.

When a pop-up modal shows up, you will only see two buttons&ndash;`Cancel` and `Create`. Close the modal by clicking the `Cancel` button.

This time, click the `üñã` button on the right-hand side to update the connector.

Click the `2. Security` tab, and you will see all fields are greyed out, which are unmodifiable.

Click either the `üñã Edit` button, and you will see all the fields become modifiable. Then click the `Definition ‚Üí` button at the right bottom corner.

At the `Definition` tab, leave everything unchanged and click the `‚úÖ Update connector` button on the right-hand side. Once the custom connector is updated, you will see the message, `‚úÖ Custom connector has been successfully updated` at the top of the screen.
