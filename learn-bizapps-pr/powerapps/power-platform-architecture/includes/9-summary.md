Power Platform provide a flexible architecture that can be tailored to support many business scenarios.

Staying up to date on the platform capabilities is essential to architecting solutions that will best leverage the capabilities

In this module, you looked at the Power Platform Architecture, including:

- Key Power Platform architecture components.
- Planning for environments.
- Capabilities of Microsoft Dataverse.
- How service limits can affect solution design.

A solution architect needs to make the most of the Power Platform architecture:

- Power Platform components are designed to work well together.
- Leverage the platform strengths, don’t focus on the weaknesses.
- Use Microsoft Azure to fill gaps where you exceed the platform's capabilities, instead of pushing the platform beyond its natural capabilities.
- Avoid using unsupported techniques for customizations.

Consider the performance impact of solution choices. There are many tools in the Power Platform that can sometimes answer the same question; choose the tool that maximizes performance and user productivity.

A solution architect needs to consider the roadmap that Microsoft publishes twice a year:

- Understand what is on the roadmap that impacts your solution architecture.
- Evaluate and decide when to adopt new emerging approaches.
- Ensure your solution architecture doesn’t use deprecated features.
- Avoid using unsupported customizations to ensure fast pace updates don’t impact your solution.

## Next steps

If you want to learn more about Power Platform architecture the Power CAT team has produced a series of videos on Power Platform architecture and best practices <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi9EhCY4z99W2QOTgbwhFZEjpqc8YZDVH>.

To learn more about best practices to secure and govern Power Platform environments see <https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/best-practices-environments/>

The next steps are to look at data modeling in Microsoft Dataverse.
