Power Platform provides a flexible architecture that can be tailored to support many business scenarios.

Staying up to date on Power Platform capabilities is essential in designing solutions that will best use these capabilities.

In this module, you learned about Power Platform architecture, including:

- Key Power Platform architecture components.
- Planning for environments.
- Capabilities of Microsoft Dataverse.
- How service limits can affect solution design.

A solution architect needs to make the most of Power Platform architecture:

- Power Platform components are designed to work together.
- Use the platform strengths rather than focusing on the weaknesses.
- Use Microsoft Azure to fill gaps where you exceed the platform's capabilities instead of pushing the platform beyond its natural capabilities.
- Avoid using unsupported techniques for customizations.

Consider the performance impact of solution choices. Many tools in Power Platform can answer the same question; choose the tool that maximizes performance and user productivity.

A solution architect needs to consider the roadmap that Microsoft publishes twice a year:

- Understand what is on the roadmap that impacts your solution architecture.
- Evaluate and decide when to adopt new emerging approaches.
- Ensure that your solution architecture doesn’t use deprecated features.
- Avoid using unsupported customizations to ensure that fast-paced updates don’t impact your solution.

## Next steps

If you want to learn more about Power Platform architecture, the Power CAT team has produced a series of videos on Power Platform architecture and [best practices](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi9EhCY4z99W2QOTgbwhFZEjpqc8YZDVH).

For more information, see [Power Platform best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/best-practices-environments/).

For more information on Dynamics 365 apps, see the [Dynamics 365 Fundamentals Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/dynamics-365-fundamentals/?azure-portal=true).

The next steps are to look at data modeling in Microsoft Dataverse.
