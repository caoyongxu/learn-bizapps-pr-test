Throughout this learning path, you've learned how to plan the details behind a canvas app build and all the minute decisions involved. Consider current processes that you have and assess potential use cases and the requirements that might come from them. You can now translate those requirements to an actual solution and begin building that solution. The next module will cover further functionality and help you connect to data sources, making your solution more robust.
