# Version your apps
If something goes wrong with your app, or you save a change to an app you shouldn't have, it's good to know that PowerApps can help you out. For apps that are saved in the cloud, PowerApps keeps a history of the changes that you make. You can view the versions that are saved and restore your app to a previous version if necessary.

Keep in mind that if the app is shared, the people you shared with also receive the restored version.

## View versions of your app
1. In web.powerapps.com, click or tap the info icon.

3. View all version of your app that PowerApps created as you developed the app.



## Restore a previous version
1. Select **Restore** for the  version you want to restore.
1. Select **Restore** again to confirm.

When you restore a version of an app, the newly restored version is incremented with a new version number and will appear at the top of the list. A new version will will never overwrite a previous version number.
