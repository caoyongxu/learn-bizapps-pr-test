## Version your apps
If something goes wrong with your app, or if you saved changes to your app that you shouldn't have, it's good to know that Microsoft PowerApps can help you out. For apps that are saved in the cloud, PowerApps keeps a history of the changes you make. You can view the versions that are saved and restore your app to a previous version if necessary.

Keep in mind that if the app is shared, the people you shared it with also receive the restored version.

### View versions of your app
1. On web.powerapps.com, select the **Details** button.

2. Select the **Versions** tab.
3. View all version of your app that PowerApps created as you developed the app.

### Restore a previous version
1. Select **Restore** for the version you want to restore.
1. Select **Restore** again to confirm the action.

    A new version is added to your list.

When you restore a version of an app, the newly restored version gets a new, incremented version number and appears at the top of the list. A new version will never overwrite a previous version.

Now that you know how to view versions of your apps and restore them if necessary, let's move on to the next unit, where you'll learn how to share your apps.
