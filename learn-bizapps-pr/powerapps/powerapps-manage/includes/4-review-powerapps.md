## Review

Congratulations on building your first app! Let's do a quick review of what you've learned so far:

- You built an app based on data in a Microsoft Excel workbook that's stored on Microsoft OneDrive for Business. You learned that Microsoft PowerApps can connect almost as easily to any cloud service data sources you're already using, like Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Azure, Google Drive, and Salesforce.
- You customized the app to make it your own, by modifying the look and feel, and by adding Excel-like functions.
- You learned that you can share apps instantly with your co-workers across the web, tablets, and mobile devices.
- You set up app environments so that you can separate a working environment from the one you want to share with your team.

And you probably did all this before lunch. Outstanding!

The easiest way to advance your skills is to run the samples, play around with the templates, and generate more apps from your own data.
