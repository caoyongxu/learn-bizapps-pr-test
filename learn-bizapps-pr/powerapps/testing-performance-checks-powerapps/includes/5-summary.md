App performance is the difference between user adoption or abandonment,
and sometimes the difference can be as simple as one change. In this
module, you learned about common performance bottlenecks, how to test
for them, and some options for mitigating the bottlenecks. Here are some key facts to remember:

-   The interaction between the data source and app is the most common
    cause of poor performance.

-   There are many different techniques for mitigating performance issues, such as collections, choosing the correct data source, and the Concurrent function.

-   Always perform testing in an environment that is similar to your user's environment. This is especially important when building apps for slower networks.
