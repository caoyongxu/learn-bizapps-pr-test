Building apps require a strong understanding of what your data source
can and cannot support. This module covered what is delegation in
Power Apps, the variables that determine when delegation is and is not
available, and how to adjust the limits of delegation. These items are
important to remember:

-   Delegation is used to increase performance and reduce the amount of
    data sent between Power Apps and the data source.

-   Delegation is function, predicate, and data source dependent.

-   When delegation is not occurring, Power Apps provides warnings in
    the Power Apps Studio to the maker but does not warn the app user.

-   The default amount of records returned by a non-delegable query is
    500, it can be increased to a maximum of 2,000.

In the next module, you'll focus on gaining access to additional data
sources by building custom connectors.
