For this module's scenario, you are an employee of Contoso, an electronic manufacturing company. Contoso has been using a shared Microsoft Excel workbook to track employee accidents at its various locations. The workbook contains a table in which location managers can record data that is related to employee accidents. Recently, they've been having problems with data being accidentally overwritten by multiple users of the workbook, data inconsistencies in some fields, and overall performance issues with the workbook. Your manager has asked you to replace the workbook with a better solution that will eliminate these issues.

The requirements of the solution include:

-   A user-friendly web interface for managers to log details about the accidents

-   Ability for managers to use dropdown menu selections to eliminate data inconsistencies

-   Ability for managers to quickly view and report on accidents

-   Ability for managers to quickly notify employees of the accident that is being recorded

Based on these requirements, you have decided that a model-driven app is the best solution that will fit these requirements. You will use Microsoft Dataverse as the database to store the details about the employee accidents. Using model-driven apps together with Dataverse has the following benefits:

-   **Simple to manage** - The data (accidents that are being recorded) and the metadata (data that is related to employee information, location information, and type of accidents) are stored in the cloud so that you can be confident about storage details.

-   **Rich metadata** - You can build relationships between the data and metadata to maintain consistency in the data that is being recorded.

-   **Logic and validation** - You can define business rules, workflows, and business process flows to ensure data quality and adoption among users.

-   **Ease of reporting** - You can modify views so that managers and users have access to the data that is relevant to them.

-   **Ease of data entry** - You can modify entry forms so that users can enter data faster and more accurately.

Now that you have chosen the appropriate direction for building your complete solution, you can explore the complete solution to gain a better idea of what you will be building in this learning path.
