Contoso has been using a shared Excel workbook to track employee accidents at its various locations. The workbook contains a table in which location managers record data related to employee's accidents. Recently they've been having problems with data being accidentally overwritten by multiple users of the workbook, data inconsistencies in some of the fields and overall performance issues with the workbook. Your manager has asked you to replace the workbook with a better solution, which will eliminate the issues being experienced.

The requirements of the solution include the following:

-   An easy to use web interface for managers to log the details regarding the accidents

-   Ability for managers to use drop down selections in order to eliminate data inconsistencies

-   Ability for managers to quickly view and report on accidents

-   Ability for managers to quickly notify employees of the accident being recorded

Based on these requirements, you have decided that a model-driven app is the best solution that will fit these requirements. Dataverse will be used as the database to store the details about the employee accidents. Using model-drive apps together with Dataverse has the following benefits:

-   **Simple to manage:** The data (accidents being recorded) and the metadata (data related to employee information, location information and type of accidents) are stored in the cloud so you are confident about the details of how they are stored

-   **Rich metadata:** You can easily build relations between the data and metadata to maintain consistency in the data being recorded

-   **Logic and validation:** You can easily define business rules, workflows, and business process flows to ensure data quality and adoption among users

-   **Ease of Reporting:** You can easily modify views so that managers and users have access to the data relevant to them

-   **Ease of data entry:** You can easily modify entry forms so that users can enter data faster and accurately

Now that you have chosen the appropriate path to build your solution, lets quickly explore the final solution to give you an idea of what we will be building in this learning path.
