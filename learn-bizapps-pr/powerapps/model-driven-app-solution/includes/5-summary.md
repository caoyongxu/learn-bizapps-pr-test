This module discussed the concept of translating a business process into a model-driven app. The most important piece is to have a solid understanding of the flow that is used in the business process and a well-planed data model that mimics that flow. It's helpful to ask questions about the business process and to document those answers by using a diagram. Relationships are the foundation of the data model and play a significant role in how the model-driven app works.
