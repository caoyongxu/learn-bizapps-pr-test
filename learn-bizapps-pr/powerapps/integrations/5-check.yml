  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You need to allow en external system to push data into Dataverse. What should you use to make this integration efficient?
    choices: 
    - content: Change Tracking
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Change Tracking is used to extract delta changes in data from Dataverse. Change Tracking is not used to push data into Dataverse.
    - content: Azure Service Bus
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Service Bus is used to received events from Dataverse. Azure Service Bus is not used to push data into Dataverse.
    - content: Azure Function
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Functions can be used to write data into Dataverse but do not in themselves enable writes into Dataverse to be efficient.
    - content: Alternate key
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Alternate keys allow data to be pushed into Dataverse without knowing the unique id (GUID) of the row. Alternate Keys remove the need for a query to be executed to find the GUID of the row.
  - content: You need to integrate with another system. You must ensure that the other system processes the data successfully. What should you use?
    choices: 
    - content: Azure Service Bus Queue
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An Azure Service Bus Queue allows messages to be posted but the message are sent with no response.
    - content: Azure Relay
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: An Azure Relay allows messages to be posted and a response posted in return with the success of failure of the transaction. 
    - content: Azure Event Hub
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An Azure Event Hub allows messages to be posted but the message are sent with no response. An Event Hub distributes the message to the various subscribers.
    - content: Webhook
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Webhook can be called synchronously and return a message, however, a Webhook will fail if the other system is not available.
  - content: You need to integrate systems. The systems must not be dependent upon the other being available or dependent upon changes made to each system. What sort of integration should be created?
    choices: 
    - content: Loosely coupled
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Systems should be as independent as possible from each other, so that changes to one do not heavily impact the other. Loosely coupled systems are interdependent of each other.
    - content: Low cohesion
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Low cohesion would mean that the functionality is spread out all over your systems. This makes the integration interdependent between the systems.
    - content: Batch
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Whether the integration is batch or event driven will have no bearing as to the level of dependency between the systems.
    - content: Tightly coupled
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: High level of coupling mean that your system knows too much about the inner workings of the other. Systems that know too much about other systems make changes hard to coordinate and make systems brittle.
