Unlike canvas apps, where you build out an app screen by screen adding
logic and code as you go, model-driven apps can be created with a few
clicks of the mouse. How? Model-driven apps use a component-focused
approach to develop the app. This also means though, when developing
canvas apps you have complete control over the look and feel, whereas
with model-driven apps, the layout is mainly based on the components you
add to the app. 

There are a number of different components and component properties you 
can add and modify when designing an app.

Model-driven app design provides the following benefits:

-   Rich component-focused no-code design environments

-   Create complex responsive apps with a similar UI across a variety of devices from desktop to mobile

-   Rich design capability

-   Your app can be distributed as a solution
