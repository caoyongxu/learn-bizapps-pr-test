Unlike canvas apps, where you build out an app screen-by-screen by adding
logic and code as you go, model-driven apps can be created with a few
simple steps. Model-driven apps use a component-focused
approach to develop the app. When developing
canvas apps, you have complete control over the appearance and behavior, whereas
with model-driven apps, the layout is mainly based on the components that you
add to the app. 

With model-driven apps, a number of different components and component properties are available for you 
to add and modify when designing an app.

Model-driven app design provides the following benefits:

-   Rich component-focused, no-code design environments

-   An ability to create complex responsive apps with a similar UI across a variety of devices from desktop to mobile

-   Robust design capability

-   Apps can be distributed as a solution
