The goal of this module was to help you become familiar with the 
basics of Microsoft Dataverse and creating model-driven apps. 
Dataverse lets you store and manage data that is used 
by business applications. Tables within Dataverse 
are used to store data.

To review, this module explained the following concepts:
- Dataverse data is stored in tables. 
- You can use as many default tables as possible to quickly build apps.
- You can create new tables.
- Data is stored in a way that users can see it only if you grant them access. 
- Sample apps and templates are available to help you learn and create your own apps.
