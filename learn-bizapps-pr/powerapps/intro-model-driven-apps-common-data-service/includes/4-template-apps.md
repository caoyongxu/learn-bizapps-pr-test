On [powerapps.com](https://powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true), you can use a sample app to explore design possibilities. You'll also discover concepts that you can apply as you develop your own apps. Every sample app uses fictitious data to showcase a real-world scenario.

For more details, be sure to check out the documentation that's specific to each sample app.

## Get sample apps

Before you can play around with or edit the model-driven sample apps, you must set them up in a Common Data Service database. First, create a trial environment and a database, and be sure to select the **Include sample apps and data** check box.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By selecting this check box, you install all available sample apps in your database. Sample apps are for educational and demonstration purposes. We don't recommend installing them in production databases.

## Run a sample app

1. Sign in to [powerapps.com](https://powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true) and select any of the sample apps available, for this example we will select *Fundraiser*.
