Whether you are building a canvas app or model-driven app, Common
Data Service is going to be the ideal data source. Why? Because it is
the foundational data source of the Power Platform. This means you will
see the most functionality, the deepest integrations, the most features,
and the best ease of use for any of the available data sources. From
simple web based data design to applying robust role based security, the
Common Data Service is an easy platform to get started designing your
data structures and keeping them safe. Then with your data in place, you
have rich integration capabilities from Power Apps and the rest of the
Power Platform. And by applying business rules, you can trust your
business integrity will be maintained no matter what tool you use to
interact with the data.

Another great thing about utilizing Common Data Service is that all
of your data is stored in entities. An entity is a set of records used
to store data, similar to how a table stores data within a database.
Common Data Service includes a base set of standard entities that cover
typical scenarios, but you can also create custom entities specific to
your organization. Standard and custom entities within Common Data
Service provide a secure and cloud-based storage option for your data.
Entities let you create a business-focused definition of your
organization's data for use within apps. Here are some of the benefits
of using the Common Data Service and entities:

-   **Easy to manage** - Both the metadata and data are stored in the
    cloud. You don't need to worry about the details of how they're
    stored.

-   **Easy to secure** - Data is securely stored so that users can see
    it only if you grant them access. Role-based security allows you to
    control access to entities for different users within your
    organization.

-   **Access your Dynamics 365 Data** - If you use Dynamics 365, data 
    from your Dynamics 365 application is also stored within Common Data 
    Service allowing you to quickly build apps which leverage your 
    Dynamics 365 data and extend your apps using Power Apps.

-   **Rich metadata** - Data types and relationships are leveraged
    directly within Power Apps.

-   **Logic and validation** - Define calculated fields, business
    rules, workflows, and business process flows to ensure data quality
    and drive business processes.

-   **Productivity tools** - Entities are available within the add-ins
    for Microsoft Excel to increase productivity and ensure data
    accessibility.

Now that you have a better understanding of how Common Data Service works and
are aware of some of the benefits, let's take a look at how these can be applied 
in a model-driven app.
