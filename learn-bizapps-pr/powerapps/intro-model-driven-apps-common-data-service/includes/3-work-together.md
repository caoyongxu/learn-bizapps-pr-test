When creating a model-driven app, entities from the Common Data Service
are essentially your building blocks. Model-driven appsÂ start with your
data model, building up from the shape of your core business data and
processes in the Common Data Service to model forms, views, and other
components. 

This is why it's important to ensure your business data and business 
processes at the data level are structured properly before
composing your app. Model-driven apps will automatically generate a
great UI that is responsive across devices, but remember this relies 
heavily on how your data is modeled in Common Data Service.
