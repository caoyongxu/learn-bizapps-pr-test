When creating a model-driven app, you can use tables from Microsoft Dataverse
as your building blocks. Model-driven appsÂ start with your
data model, building up from the shape of your core business data and
processes in Dataverse to model forms, views, and other
components. 

It's important to ensure that your business data and business 
processes at the data level are structured properly before you 
compose your app. Model-driven apps will automatically generate a
UI that is responsive across devices; however, this outcome 
relies heavily on how your data is modeled in Dataverse.

## Approach to model-driven app making

When creating model-driven apps, it's important to focus on three areas:

- Modeling business data
- Defining business processes
- Composing the app.

More information on creating model-driven apps is included in the Create relationships, business rules, calculations, and rollups in Dataverse Learning Path and in [Overview of building model-driven apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview).
