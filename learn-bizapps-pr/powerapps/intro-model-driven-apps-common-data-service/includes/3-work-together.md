When creating a model-driven app, you can use entities from Common Data Service
as your building blocks. Model-driven appsÂ start with your
data model, building up from the shape of your core business data and
processes in Common Data Service to model forms, views, and other
components. 

It's important to ensure that your business data and business 
processes at the data level are structured properly before you 
compose your app. Model-driven apps will automatically generate a
UI that is responsive across devices; however, this outcome 
relies heavily on how your data is modeled in Common Data Service.
