In this module, you learn how to use application lifecycle management with the Power Platform, including:

- Learning about Microsoft's vision and the solution architectâ€™s role in ALM.

- Creating an environment strategy.

- Defining a solution structure for your deliverables.

- Automating deployments with Azure DevOps.

As a solution architect, you should understand how to:

- Establish ALM process and procedures. Establishing an application lifecycle management process should be done at the start of the project.

- Create a repeatable process. Having a repeatable process saves time and ensures consistent results.

- Design ALM to fit your project. ALM is not a one-size-fits-all solution, you must size it to fit your project.

## Deployment checklist

Before you progress with building and deploying your solution, you need to ensure that the following items have been addressed:

- Proper environment access has been established, such as security groups.
- Data loss prevention policies are correct for solution environments.
- Service Principals and service accounts that are necessary for connections are established and configured.
- Environment settings have been documented and configured in each environment.
