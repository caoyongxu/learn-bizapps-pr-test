  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Which type of environment should you use for a proof of concept?
    choices: 
    - content: Community
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Community Plan (Developer) environment is a personal environment that can't be shared.
    - content: Production
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Production environments are used for live data and users. It should not be used for proofs of concept because they are thrown away.
    - content: Sandbox
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Production environments are used for development and testing. It should not be used for proofs of concept because they are thrown away.
    - content: Trial
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Trial environments are used to try new features and perform proofs of concept because they are automatically deleted after 30 days.
  - content: You need to remove a component that has already been deployed to production. What should you do?
    choices: 
    - content: Clone a patch
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Using the Clone a patch option to update a solution is no longer recommended.
    - content: Clone solution
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Using the Clone solution option to update a solution is no longer recommended.
    - content: Import a new version of the solution with the Update option
      isCorrect: false

    - content: Import a new version of the solution with the Upgrade option
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The Upgrade option removes components that are not in the new solution.
  - content: You want to partition your solutions by creating separate solutions for each type of component. What is this called?
    choices: 
    - content: Horizontal splitting
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Horizontal splitting refers to creating solutions that only contain components of the same type.
    - content: Solution layering
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Solution layers describe the dependency chain for components of all solutions that affect the behavior of the component.
    - content: Solution segmentation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Adding only what subcomponents are required to a solution is known as segmenting a solution.
    - content: Vertical layering
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Vertical layering will group components into functional areas.
