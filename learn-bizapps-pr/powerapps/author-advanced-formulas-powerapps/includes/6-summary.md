In this module, you learned how to use functions that process tables of
data. This allows you to do things such as perform mathematical
operations, split and combine data, and process almost any function you
want on the records. Some key takeaways to consider include:

-   Power Apps has functions that process single records, multiple
    records, and some that can do either.

-   Using functions that count or summarize data can provide a better
    user experience.

-   **ForAll** is a powerful function that has a lot more rules and
    considerations that any other Power Apps function.

In the next module, you will learn more about functions for performing
custom updates to your data in Power Apps.
