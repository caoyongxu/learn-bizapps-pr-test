  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: For this solution, we've decided to use multiple tables and relate them. What is our primary reason for doing this?
    choices: 
    - content: To implement data validation.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Parent-child relationships don't inherently help with data validation.
    - content: To allow us to restrict what information is visible or accessible to the end users.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: While parent-child relationships could help us restrict what security groups can see what data, that isn't of interest to us in this case. 
    - content: To make data entry easier.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Parent-child relationships don't make data entry easier. In fact, if your user is editing directly in the data source, they make data entry more difficult.
    - content: To limit having duplicative information in every line.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Parent-child relationships help prevent having multiple repetitive fields in a table. Read more [here](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-entity-relationships/?azure-portal=true).
  - content: Which of the following isn't a reason why we want to use canvas apps in this solution?
    choices: 
    - content: Canvas apps are quickly and easily spun up.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: While Canvas apps are quicker to spin up than more traditionally coded apps, they can still take time, depending on the complexity of the problem. Model-driven apps are less customizable and thus are quicker to spin up.
    - content: Canvas apps are highly customizable.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: We want to use canvas apps in this case because they're highly customizable and allow us to tailor our solutions to our specific needs.
    - content: Canvas apps can access a plethora of data sources, including Dataverse, which allow us to use already existing user information.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: We want to use Outlook and Dataverse in this solution, and down the road may be interested in bringing in even more data sources. This is an important part of our solution.
    - content: Canvas apps are easy to learn.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: If you have ever used Excel formulas, you have the foundational knowledge needed to learn Power Apps. Many of the functions are the same, and the easy, drag and drop Power Apps studio makes it easy to jump in. 
  - content: What kind of data should be in the parent table of a parent-child relationship? 
    choices: 
    - content: Data that will be accessed the most.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The parent table should house any information that is relevant to all of the child records.  
    - content: Data that needs to be access-restricted based on security permissions.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The parent table should house any information that is relevant to all of the child records.
    - content: Data that relates to some, but not all, of the child records.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The information from a parent record must apply to all child records to have a proper parent-child relationship.
    - content: Data that stays the same across all child records.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Parent-child relationships allow us to eliminate duplicative information from being stored.
