  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: For this solution, you've decided to use multiple tables and then relate them. What is your primary reason for doing this process?
    choices: 
    - content: To implement data validation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Parent-child relationships don't inherently help with data validation.
    - content: To allow you to restrict what information is visible or accessible to users
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: While parent-child relationships could help restrict certain security groups from viewing specific types of data, it's not of concern in this case. 
    - content: To make data entry easier
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Parent-child relationships don't make data entry easier. In fact, editing directly in the data source makes data entry more difficult.
    - content: To limit having duplicate information in every line
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Parent-child relationships help prevent the occurrence of repetitive fields in a table.
  - content: Which of the following options is not a reason for using canvas apps in this solution?
    choices: 
    - content: Canvas apps are quickly and easily activated.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: While Canvas apps are quicker to activate than more traditionally coded apps, they can still take time, depending on the complexity of the problem. Model-driven apps are less customizable and thus quicker to activate.
    - content: Canvas apps are highly customizable.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You want to use canvas apps in this case because they're highly customizable and will allow you to tailor the solutions to your specific needs.
    - content: Canvas apps can access numerous data sources, including Dataverse, which will allow you to use already existing user information.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You want to use Outlook and Dataverse in this solution. Later, you might be interested in bringing in more data sources. Canvas apps are an important part of your solution.
    - content: Canvas apps are simple to learn.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: If you have used Excel formulas, you have the necessary foundational knowledge to learn Power Apps. Many functions are similar, and the drag-and-drop functionality of Power Apps Studio helps make it easier to start.
  - content: What kind of data should be in the parent table of a parent-child relationship? 
    choices: 
    - content: Data that will be accessed the most
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The parent table should contain information that is relevant to all child records.  
    - content: Data that needs to be access-restricted based on security permissions
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The parent table should contain information that is relevant to all child records.
    - content: Data that relates to some, but not all, child records
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The information from a parent record must apply to all child records to have a proper parent-child relationship.
    - content: Data that stays the same across all child records
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Parent-child relationships allow you to eliminate duplicate information from being stored.
