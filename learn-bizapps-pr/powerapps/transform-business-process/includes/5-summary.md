This module explained how you can shape and improve your own business process with a canvas app from Power Apps. Additionally, you learned how to translate your data to a more flexible and dynamic data model. Going forward in this learning path, you'll learn about the mechanics of creating the app; however, evaluating and understanding the planning stages is critical to creating the ideal app for your business and your users.

Key concepts from this module are:

- Assessing requirements is the first step toward designing a solution.

  This solution identified the relevant stakeholders (traveling employees, their supervisors, and accounting).

- Planning a broad map of your app before considering the details is beneficial.

  This solution outlined the three main pages where you can start.

- Using best practices of data modeling (such as parent-child relationships) is essential.

  This solution showed that the optimal data structure will require multiple related tables.
