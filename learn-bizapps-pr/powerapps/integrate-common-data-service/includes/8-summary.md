The ability to easily surface and interact with Common Data Service data is one of the core benefits of implementing a Power Apps portal.  Entity lists, entity forms, and web forms are configurable to enable access to Common Data Service data in portals and turn content portals into functional web apps. They are configurable and extendable to satisfy the most demanding business requirements.

By now you should be able to:

* Understand the portal components available to surface and interact with Common Data Service data on the portal.
* Identify the various features of the portal components.
* Configure entity form and web form metadata to access individual records.
* Display a list of data and an associated drill down for details.
* Plan and configure a web form to implement a business process on a portal.
* Trigger classic Common Data Service workflows from the portal.

## Next steps

The next step in exploring the portal's capabilities is to study the inner workings of web templates and advanced Liquid constructs that can help in building robust and flexible web pages.
