You can add a table form to a webpage by using Power Apps portals Studio from the components menu. However, not all available settings can be configured in portals Studio. A number of additional configuration options are available for table forms in the Portal Management app. To access a table form in the Portal Management app:

1. Go to [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true).
1. In the upper-right corner, use the environment selector to select the target environment.
1. From the **Apps** list, locate and open the Portal Management app. (The app type is Model-driven).
1. In the left navigation, select **Table Forms**.
1. Open the form that was created previously in portals Studio.

Forms can include actions for the user to interact with the row. Detailed configurations for each form element are available by using additional **Table Form Metadata** rows.

## Configuration

The following sections describe different ways that you can configure table forms.

### Form options

Most of the form options support customization of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) elements to change visual appearance. You can specify text elements such as labels, messages, and tooltips in multiple languages. For example, the default message after the form submission is "Saved," but you can customize the message for each of the enabled portal languages.

Other form options include:

- Enable CAPTCHA to prevent spamming on forms that are open to anonymous users.
- Control validation behavior, for example, whether to mark all columns as required regardless of the form setting.

See the [Form options](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/entity-forms?azure-portal=true#form-options) documentation for a complete list of available options.

### On success settings

Behaviors on successful form submission options are to display a message or redirect to another page or URL. Displaying a message is common for "contact us" and similar forms where submissions are anonymous and repeatable. Redirect is used in scenarios where a portal user, typically authenticated, has been dealing with a list of rows and views or has been editing some of them.

Configure the success message on the **Additional Settings** tab.

### Additional settings

Additional settings define more aspects of form behavior, including styling, translation of UI elements, and so on.

#### Actions

Because each table form deals with an individual table row, several actions are available for you to use to run against this row, for example **Update**, **Delete**, **Deactivate**, and so on. Configure these actions that are displayed at runtime as command buttons by selecting **Additional Settings > Action Button Configuration**. All commands include options to rename the buttons and change their placement on the form.

> [!TIP]
> Some of the settings and configuration options are hidden. Use the **Advanced settings** check box to display all available options for the form and individual actions. For example, to change the default success message, add the **Submit** action and select **Advanced settings**.

Other actions that you can configure include:

- **Associate Current Portal User on Insert** - Use these options to keep track of which of the portal contacts created or updated the row. This feature creates a portal equivalent of `Created By` and `Modified By` columns in Microsoft Dataverse. You can also set parental relationships where applicable. For example, if a new account row is created, you might want to automatically set the current contact as a primary contact.

- **Add Attach File** - Several options are available for you to add a file upload control to your form. Configuration is flexible and supports multiple files, storage options, MIME type, and size restrictions (for example, you can restrict uploads to images up to 2 MB in size).

- **Geolocation** - You can configure a table form to display a map control that either displays an existing location as a pin on a map or that allows the user to specify a location. For more information, see [Add Geolocation](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/add-geolocation/?azure-portal=true).

The form's map control requires additional configuration to tell it what the various location columns are, to assign values to them, or to retrieve values from them. For more information, see [Geolocation configuration for table forms](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/entity-forms?azure-portal=true#geolocation-configuration-for-entity-forms).

### table reference

table reference provides a way to associate the current row that is being created or updated with another target row. This feature is useful if you have multiple steps with multiple table types and want to relate the resulting rows or if the page is passed through a query string of a row ID that you want to associate.

For example, you might have an event page that displays information about an upcoming webinar. You want to include a registration button that redirects visitors to the registration page where the registration form is displayed. You can pass the event identifier in a query string and, when the registration form is submitted, you'll be able to automatically link the registration information to the event.

## Table form metadata

**Table form metadata** rows allow you to control the appearance and behavior of individual form elements, including:

- The appearance of columns, sections, and tabs. For individual columns, define default values, validation behavior, and other aspects.
- Subgrids configuration allows you to define actions for related rows, similar to table list actions.
- Behavior of notes and timeline sections, and whether new rows can be added. This feature is commonly used to allow portal users to enter comments about the row, for example, a case in progress.

> [!TIP]
> You can find some of the table form documentation in the **Web Forms** section. For example, table form metadata can be located under [Configure web form metadata for portals](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-web-form-metadata/?azure-portal=true) and [Configure Web form subgrids for portals](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-web-form-subgrid/?azure-portal=true) documentation pages in the **Web Forms** section.

## Add a table form to your portal

A table form defines the required behavior but does not contain information about how and where on the site the form should render. The two ways to render a table form in a portal are:

- Explicitly specify the table form as a target for a table list action like **Create**, **Update**, or **Edit**. In this case, the form renders in a modal pop-up window. Certain limitations apply when the form is rendered in a pop-up window, for example, creating related rows from subgrids is not available.
- Similar to a table list, you can add a table form component to a webpage from the portals studio. This action places a Liquid tag on the webpage copy to render the table form.

```twig
{% tableform name: '<<table form name>>' %}
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the table form Code Editor liquid tag.](../media/entity-form-liquid-tag.png)](../media/entity-form-liquid-tag.png#lightbox)

Because forms submit information back to the server for processing, you will have much less control over entity forms rendering as compared to entity lists.
