Microsoft Power Apps is designed to interact with data that is internal or external, and provides many ways to connect to it.  When building a canvas app, Power Apps has hundreds of data sources available.  Your data source can be traditional with tables having rows and columns, or your data can be action-based that runs different functions when you connect to it.

As you go through this module, we will explore some connections to both types of data so you can get a feel for both types and how you can interact with them.

We will look at the Office 365 Users connection so you can see how Office 365 user, manager, and direct report information all can be made available to you within your app.

You will also explore using a Gallery to experience how you can view and interact with your data. 

We'll introduce collections, a data source that Power Apps builds within the app.  Collections are essentially variables in tabular form, existing only while the app is running for the current user.

We will learn about the Patch and ForAll functions that help you update your data.

At the end of the module is a step-by-step exercise that builds a Power App connecting with external data, to put these pieces together.
