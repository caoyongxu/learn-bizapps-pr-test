Data is at the core of most apps, so you should understand how to work
with it in a canvas app. This module covered how to connect to data, how
to display data in the gallery control, and the basics of how to use
functions to transform the data in your app. These items are important
to remember:

-   Connectors can provide tables of data, actions for data, or a
    combination of both.

-   Galleries show records in a data source. You can edit the gallery
    template, and the rest of the gallery will inherit the changes.

-   Collections are variables in which you can store table data. With
    collections, you have a temporary data source in your app that you
    can easily manipulate and quickly query.



In the next module, you'll focus on shaping the data through filtering,
conditions, Search, and other functions. The final module in this
learning path will focus on how to work with forms and write data by
using the **Submit** function.
