Let's have a quick look at what we have covered in this module:

- We learned about the Portal management model-driven app and how it is used to configure specific aspects of a Power Apps portal.
- We reviewed the various Portal metadata records and how they are used to configure specific aspects of a portal.
- We walked through the structure of a web page record and the various components are used to render a web page and show content from multiple languages.
- We examined the page template and web template structure and how they apply consistent layouts and functionality of a web page.
