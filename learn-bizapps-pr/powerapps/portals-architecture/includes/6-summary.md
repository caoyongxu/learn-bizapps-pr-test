Provisioning a Power Apps portal is a straight forward process but adds a number of features and components to a Common Data Service environment.

Let's have a quick look at what we have covered in this module:

- We learned that a full, working Power Apps portal is provisioned from a starter template and is configured for specific business requirements as opposed to creating an application from scratch.
- We reviewed the various components of the Power Apps portals architecture such as the portal solutions, portal metadata and the portal web application.
- We reviewed the portal provisioning steps and where and when specific components are added to a Power Platform or Dynamics 365 environment.
- We examined the various portal maker and admin tools used to manage content and portal features.
