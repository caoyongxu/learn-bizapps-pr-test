## Portal front side editing tools

The portal front-side editing tools are legacy tools in which visitors to a portal with specialized web roles (such as administrator) can add and modify portal content and functionality directly when browsing portal pages. Along with being able to directly edit content, a pop-up tools window will appear allowing content creators to add web pages, web links and web files.  Moving forward, the recommended way to modify content is using the Portals Studio.
