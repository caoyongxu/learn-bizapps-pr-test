A Microsoft Power Apps portal that is provisioned in a Microsoft Dataverse environment is composed of three main components:

- Portal solutions
- Portal metadata
- Portal web app

A portal requires a Dataverse database to be available in the environment to install and configure some of the key components. While a portal from blank can be configured in an environment without any of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps installed, many of the templates (Customer self-service, Employee self-service, Partner, and Community portals) have dependencies on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## Portals solutions

Numerous Dataverse solutions are installed in the environment. These solutions contain a model-driven portal management app, entities, forms, views, and processes to store and manage the portal metadata. Additional solutions are installed to enable the functionality of specific templates. Solutions contain several actions, workflows, and plug-ins that are deployed to automate the creation of specific portal records and assist with the management of portal users.

The solutions should not be installed individually by an administrator but installed as part of the portal provisioning process.

## Portals metadata

Power Apps portal metadata will describe the portal website, webpages, web templates, content snippets, entity forms, entity lists, site settings, and other configuration data. The data is stored in Dataverse. A portal maker can add, modify, or delete portal metadata to specifically configure a portal application by using the Power Apps portals Studio, the Portal Management app, or the legacy front-side editing tools.

One of the distinctive features of Power Apps portals is using Dataverse as a centralized storage for the information that is required to run the portal website. Everything that portals require to run, including metadata and content, is stored in a Dataverse database, which helps make backing up and transporting portal solutions between the environments easier.

## Portals web app

A Microsoft Azure web app is configured to run the portal site by using the portal solutions and metadata. The web app is automatically configured in the same region as the Dataverse environment. This web app is accessible through the unique URL that is specified during the provisioning process. The web app is not customizable; however, portal administrators have a number of configuration options available to them, for example, they can configure the portal web app to capture detailed diagnostics logs for troubleshooting purposes.
