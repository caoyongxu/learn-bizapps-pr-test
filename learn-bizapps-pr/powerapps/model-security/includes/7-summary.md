In this module, you looked at security modeling with the Power Platform, including:

- Learning about different aspects of security architecture
- Learning about securing environments
- Learning the security features of Microsoft Dataverse
- The impact of security on performance
- Modeling different usage scenarios

Security must be considered from the start of the project. The solution architect must ensure that security is designed into the data and app models. It can be hard to change later on after the data model has been created and apps composed. Security modeling is unique to each solution; there is no one size fits all.

Different industries and business models follow different approaches to granting access. The solution architect should look for common patterns that emerge from requirements, often these emerge for how the relationships with the stakeholders of the system are managed.

Above all, the solution architect should keep things a simple as possible while still meeting the business needs to secure data and optimize the user experience.
