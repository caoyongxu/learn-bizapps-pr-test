  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You need to automate the enabling access to a Dataverse environment for users new to the organization. What should you use?
    choices: 
    - content: Access teams
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Access teams are used to easily share records from within the user interface to other users. Access teams do not enable access for new users.
    - content: Owner teams
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Owner teams can own records. The membership of an owner team is managed manually for existing users. Owner teams do not enable access for new users.
    - content: Azure AD Group teams
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure AD Group teams use the membership of the Azure AD Group to add new users to the environment. Associating a security role with the team will further enable the user to access without any administrator effort inside of Dataverse.
    - content: Default teams
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A default team is created for each business unit. When a user is added to the environment, they are added to a default team. Default teams do not enable access for new users.
  - content: You have a business unit structure with three child business units under the root, UnitA, UnitB, and Unit C. You need to allow users in UnitA to access the data in TableX owned by users in Unit C. What should you do?
    choices: 
    - content: Share TableX rows in UnitC with users in UnitA
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Sharing each row with each user is highly inefficient and will lead to slow performance.
    - content: Create a Team in UnitC, Add users in UnitA to the Team.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The users in the team will have access to the data for the Business Unit where the team is located that is, UnitC.
    - content: Create a Team in UnitA, Add users in UnitC to the Team.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This will give the users in UnitC access to data in UnitA. This is not the requirement.
    - content: Change the access levels for TableX the security role to Organization level.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Setting the access levels to Organization level will enable the users to data in all business units, not just UnitC.
  - content: What security feature should  you use for the management oversight pattern?
    choices: 
    - content: Column-level security
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Column-level security is used to restrict access to individual pieces of data in columns such as PII.
    - content: Business units
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Business units are used to segment data between user communities. They are not used for management oversight.
    - content: Sharing
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Sharing is used to bypass the strict security model hierarchy imposed by business units and security roles.
    - content: Hierarchical security
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Hierarchical security allows a user to see the data for their direct reports so that they can perform oversight of their work.
