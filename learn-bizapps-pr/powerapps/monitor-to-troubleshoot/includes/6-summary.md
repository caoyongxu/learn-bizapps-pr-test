Thisâ€¯module explored how you can use the Monitor tool from Power
Apps Studio as part of your app-building process to troubleshoot and
identify and resolve problems. Monitor captures information
about the events that occur when users run and interact with your app.
By using detail from captured events, you can identify
formulas in your app that need to be adjusted to resolve problems. With
the collaboration features in Monitor, you can remotely troubleshoot by
observing and capturing user interaction with the published apps in real time.
