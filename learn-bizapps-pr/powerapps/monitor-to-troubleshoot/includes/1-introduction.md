Monitor is a tool that you can launch from Power Apps Studio to help you troubleshoot problems and proactively improve the quality of your apps.
Using Monitor, here are some of the key things you can identify:

-   Errors using connectors

-   Large amounts of data sent/received

-   Slow response from connectors

-   Unexpected user control interactions

-   Duplicated data actions

When Monitor is activated, it captures and allows you to view a stream
of events from your running app. These events include user interaction
with controls and use of data sources.

The data captured includes all the necessary context information to
allow you to review the data to identify problems. Some of the
information included is also available from your browser's developer
tools; however, they lack app context information like the control name
and formula.

Using the details, you can make changes to correct problems identified
and retest without having to leave Power Apps Studio or Monitor. In the
following video, we show how to activate Monitor and review the data
captured.

In addition to interactively working with monitor, you can also enable
Monitor to be used in published applications to collaborate with remote
users.

In the rest of this module, we will dive deeper into how you can use
Monitor as one of your regular app building tools.
