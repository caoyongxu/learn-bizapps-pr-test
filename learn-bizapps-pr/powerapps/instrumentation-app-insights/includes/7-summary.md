Thisâ€¯module explored how you can configure your canvas app from Power Apps to send telemetry to Application Insights. Application Insights provides several ways for you to analyze your app performance and usage. You can visualize the data by using prebuilt visualizations on the Azure portal. You can use Power BI to create custom visualizations. In addition to the telemetry that is automatically captured by the Power Apps runtime, you can send custom event data by using the Trace() function. You can add calls to the Trace() function at strategic places in your app and then include contextual data to help you analyze the event later.
