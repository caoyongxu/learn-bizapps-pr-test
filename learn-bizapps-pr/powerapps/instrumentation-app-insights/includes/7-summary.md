In thisâ€¯module, we explored how you can configure your Power Apps canvas app to send telemetry to Application Insights. Application Insights provides several ways to analyze your app performance and usage. The data can be visualized using pre-built visualizations on the Azure portal. You can use Power BI to create custom visualizations. In addition to the telemetry automatically captured by the Power Apps runtime you can send custom event data using the Power Apps Trace() function. Calls to the trace function can be added at strategic places in your app and can include contextual data to help you analyze the event later.
