 title: Build user experience in portals
 description: This module focuses on what a portal maker should consider when designing and building portals. Getting started with the implementation of a portal solution requires a good understanding of the specific business requirements and the needs not only of the customer but of the customer's customers. A successful portal will be well designed and easy to navigate. It's also critical to provide portal functionality to those with accessibility needs and to provide portal features to different geographies and languages. Like any good development project, portal metadata needs to be backed up to source control and also deployed to test and production environments in a consistent managed way.
