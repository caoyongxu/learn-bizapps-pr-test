In Power Apps portals, you can search for records across multiple entities by using portalâ€™s global search functionality. You can also search within records of entity lists using entity list search functionality.

## Global search

Global search of Power Apps portal allows you to search for records across multiple entities. It also allows you to search across multiple columns and configure what columns of an entity would be searchable.

Among the benefits of global search are its ability to:

* Find matches to any word in the search term in any field in the entity. Matches can include inflectional words like stream, streaming, or streamed.
* Return results from all searchable entities in a single list sorted by relevance, based on factors like number of words matched, or their proximity to each other in the text.
* Highlight matches in the search results.
* Provide facet options that can be used to further filter search results.

### Searchable entities

The aim of the Global Search is to locate information within the site content. All content is located within the entities installed with Dynamics 365 Portals solutions, and, depending on a starter portal selected, the following entities can be searched: Web Page, Web File, Knowledge Article, Forums, Blogs, Ideas, Incident (Case). Directly related entities are also searched, for example, Blog search also includes Blog Post and Blog Comment entities.

Each of the entities above includes a **Portal Search** view that defines a set of fields searchable within the entity. You can change the columns defined in these views and publish the changes to modify the scope of the search. The name of the view is defined by the site setting `Search/IndexQueryName` and can be changed.

> [!NOTE]
>After changing the views or the view name, you need to rebuild the index as documented in the [Rebuild full search index](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/search#rebuild-full-search-index/?azure-portal=true).

Knowledge Articles have a feature that allows to mark an article as Internal Only. Articles are searchable only if they are published and their Internal Only field is set to false.

Notes and attachments on Knowledge Articles and Web Files are searched as well. More information: [Search within file attachment content.](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/search-file-attachment/?azure-portal=true)

All other entities, both system and custom, that might have been used to generate portal content, are not part of the global search. They cannot be added to the global search but targeted search functionality is available. For example, if an entity is used to generate a list of records on a page, that list can include search capabilities.

## Faceted search

Portal content may be searched by using filters based on characteristics of the content. The filters implemented by faceted portal search allow customers to find the content they want more quickly than a traditional search.

Faceted search enables portals to have search filters allowing you to choose between items like forums, blogs, pages, and knowledge articles. More filters are available for specific search types. For example, knowledge articles can be filtered by Record Type, Modified Date, Rating, and Products to help customers find the content they need.

Faceted search can be enabled or disabled using `Search/FacetedView` site setting. Individual parts of faceted search can be disabled by deactivating specific entity views in Dynamics 365. Similar entities can be grouped together, for example, search result type **Documents** describes both Knowledge Articles attachments and Web Files.

You can learn more about faceted search configuration in [Use faceted search to improve portal search](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/improve-portal-search-faceted-search/?azure-portal=true).

## Configuration

Global Search is highly configurable and configuration is available for both functionality and user interface for the search results.

### Related site settings

Every aspect of the Global Search functionality can be configured using Site Settings that are described in details in [Related site settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/search#related-site-settings/?azure-portal=true).

### Content snippets

Visual aspects of the Global Search can be configured using relevant Content Snippets. They define elements of the search user interface including faceted search. The configurable elements including captions, titles, tooltips, buttons, and others. Because Content Snippets are language-aware, it's easy to adapt the look and feel of the search for the multi-lingual audience.
