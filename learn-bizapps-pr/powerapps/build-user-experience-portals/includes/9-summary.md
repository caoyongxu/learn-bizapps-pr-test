A portal maker should consider specific details when designing and building portals. Implementing a portal solution requires knowledge of the specific business requirements and needs of the customer. Along with being simplistic and well-designed, a successful portal should provide functionality in consideration of geographical location, language, and accessibility needs. Additionally, portal makers should ensure that portal metadata is backed up to source control and deployed to test and production environments in a consistent and structured way.

By now, you should be able to:

- Recognize business requirements that you can meet with portal functionality, and identify those requirements that need deeper development or whether other technology should be considered.
- Design a portal, including page placement, site map best practices, and content planning.
- Ensure accessibility in the portals.
- Configure and manage a multilingual portal.
