In this module, we covered what a portal maker should consider when designing and building portals. Getting started with the implementation of a portal solution requires a good understanding of the specific business requirements and the needs not only of the customer but of the customer's customers.  A successful portal will be well designed and easy to navigate.  It's also critical to provide portal functionality to those with accessibility needs and to provide portal features to different geographies and languages. Like any good development project, portal metadata needs to be backed up to source control and also deployed to test and production environments in a consistent, managed way.

By now you should be able to:

- Recognize business requirements that you can meet with portal functionality and those that require deeper development or if other technology should be considered
- Understand how to design a portal, including page placement, site map best practices, and content planning
- Ensure accessibility in the portals
- Configure and manage a multi-lingual portal
