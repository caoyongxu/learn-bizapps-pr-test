A common requirement for business app data storage is to have a data column that has a standardized, infrequently changing list of values to help ensure data consistency. Users who are entering data would choose an option from a list instead of typing a free-form value. Examples of these options include a list of countries, incident priority, satisfaction rating, and so on.

Microsoft Dataverse has two table column types that support this concept: **choice** and **choices**. Choice columns allow a user to pick a single value from the list, whereas choices columns allow the selection of multiple values. Both column types can use a single list of known values. For example, **Primary Category** could be a choice column and **Other Categories** could be a choices column, which would allow for multiple selections. In this example, both could have the same list of categories.

The system, or a customizer, would define the list of known choice values for a choice or choices column, and they would store the values as table column metadata. Unlike application data, only an app maker can modify it, not a user of an app. A benefit of this feature is when you're building an app that works with a list of values. Your formulas can use the name of the choice list and the display name of the values in the formula. For example, the following formula sets a color on an item's fill property based on the **Category** column, which is a choice column.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the following Power Fx formula: Switch( ThisItem.Category, 'Category (Accounts)'.'Preferred Customer', Green, 'Category (Accounts)'.'Standard', Black. )](../media/switch.png)](../media/switch.png#lightbox)

As you compose this formula, the editor will know the possible values for the **Category** column and will allow you to select the value to compare from the list of known values for the choice column.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add or change values on a choice list, and the modified item is not showing in the editor, make sure that you refresh the table on the data panel by selecting the ellipsis (**...**) next to the table and selecting **Refresh** from the pop-up menu.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of a Refresh menu item in a pop-up menu for a Dataverse table. The menu is invoked by selecting the ellipsis next to the table.](../media/refresh.png)](../media/refresh.png#lightbox)

## Local versus global

You can set up the list of available values as local or global for choice and choices columns. **Local choice** list values are used only for the column where they're defined. The **Global choice** option allows the list to be used for multiple columns in the same table or in different tables. We recommend that you select **Global choice** to encourage reuse of the same choices unless you're confident that the values only apply to that single column. You will select **Global choice** or **Local choice** when you create a new column and a list of values and it can't be changed later.

> [![Screenshot of choice column properties in the maker interface, showing the Global choice and Local choice options highlighted.](../media/global.png)](../media/global.png#lightbox)

How you reference the list of values in your formulas depends on if they're local or global. For example, if you created a choice column on the Account table named **Priority**, with values of **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**, you would use the list of values as follows:

- **Local** - 'Priority (Accounts)'.High

- **Global** - 'Priority'.High

The difference between the two options is that the **Local** list includes the table name, **(Accounts)**. This factor matters because you'll need to make sure that you're referencing the correct list of values.

## Display column values

When the data for choice or choices columns is stored in the Dataverse row, only the numeric value is stored, not the text. For choices columns, a comma-separated list of numeric values is stored to represent multiple selections.

How you display values in a control, such as a label, is different for choice and choices columns. Choice fields can be used to set the value of a label to display the list text value. For example, if you had a **Category** choice field for the category of customer, you could display that field in a label in a gallery by using the following formula.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Power Fx formula: ThisItem.Category.](../media/category.png)](../media/category.png#lightbox)

For choices columns, the property on the record is of type Table. It's a single column table with a value column, with each row representing a selected value. To display a user-friendly, comma-separated list of text values, some preprocessing is required. For example, if you had a **Preferred Delivery** column that allowed users to choose one or more weekdays for delivery, you'd use the following formula to set the **Text** property on a label.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the Power Fx formula: Concat(ThisItem.'Preferred Delivery',Text(Value), ", ").](../media/delivery.png)](../media/delivery.png#lightbox)

This formula would result in the following display of the list of selected values.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of a screen showing preferred delivery as Monday and Tuesday, which is the output of the Power Fx formula.](../media/list.png)](../media/list.png#lightbox)

## Choice vs. lookup

One common data modeling decision is choosing between a choice column and a lookup column or between a choices column and a many-to-many relationship. This decision can affect how you manage the list of values and the formulas that you can apply. Consider the differences that are listed in the following table.

| Choice or choices | Lookup or many-to-many relationship |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| List modified by maker, no user editing | List is only table data and normal security applies |
| Data stored as a whole number (choice) or a comma-separated list of numbers (choices) | Data stored as a table reference |
| No built-in way to inactivate or retire choice | Supports inactive state on row and can be filtered by formulas in app to limit selection |
| Treated as a solution component with full ALM support | Treated as reference data |
| Only has label and value, and only label is useable in formulas (for example, filter and sorting only on display label) | Can add other data to a look-up target table that can be used in formulas (for example, filter and sorting on any column that is added to table) |
| Localization built in | Handle localization yourself |
| No built-in support of dependent choice columns | Easier to data model and implement dependent columns (see [Create a dependent dropdown list in a canvas app](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/dependent-drop-down-lists/?azure-portal=true)) |

After you have created the column, you can't change the data type; therefore, before you create the column, consider how the apps and automation will be using the data.
