In thisâ€¯module, we explored how you can use Power Fx formulas to work with Microsoft Dataverse choice and choices columns. These column data types present the user with a fixed list of values defined by the maker. Choice columns allow selection of a single value while choices columns allow selection of multiple values. These column types are commonly used to filter rows from tables using the filter() Power Fx function. Editing these columns is easy with the built-in edit form support that automatically configures the form fields. Patch can be used also to individually modify the column values to support scenarios unsuitable for using forms.
