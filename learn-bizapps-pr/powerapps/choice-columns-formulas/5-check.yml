    choices:

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The Blank() function would set to "no value" or "unknown value" like it was before being set.
    - content: Empty()
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Empty() isn't a valid Power Fx function.
    - content: IsBlank()
      isCorrect: false
