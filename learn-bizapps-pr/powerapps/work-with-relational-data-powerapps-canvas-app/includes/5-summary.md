Using relational data is key to building apps that work well and scale well. In this module, you learned about relational concepts, how PowerApps supports relationships, and how Common Data Service makes working with relational data even easier. These items are important to remember:

-   Using relational data with your PowerApps apps allows you to build
    scalable solutions.

-   You can use the Filter and LookUp functions to connect parent and
    child tables.

-   Common Data Service has built in capabilities for creating relationships and allows you to easily use the dot (.) notation to expand on related data.

In the next module, you will learn about data source limits and how
PowerApps uses delegation to enhance performance.
