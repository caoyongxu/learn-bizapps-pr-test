Using relational data is key to building apps that work well and scale well. In this module, you learned about relational concepts, how Power Apps supports relationships, and how Microsoft Dataverse makes working with relational data even easier. These items are important to remember:

- Using relational data with your Power Apps apps allows you to build
    scalable solutions.

- You can use the Filter and LookUp functions to connect parent and
    child tables.

- Dataverse has built in capabilities for creating relationships and allows you to easily use the dot (.) notation to expand on related data.

In the next module, you'll learn about data source limits and how
Power Apps uses delegation to enhance performance.
