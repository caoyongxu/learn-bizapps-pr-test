In this module, we covered the process of modifying forms to create an efficient data entry experience for users. We learned that forms are the main user interface in which app users can interact with the records being stored in underlying tables. Additionally, we learned that views are the primary forms in which app users can review records being stored in the tables. Both two components are the main back bones of a model-driven app. In the next module, we will put all the components together into a single model-driven app.
