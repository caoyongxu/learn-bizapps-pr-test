This module explained the process of modifying forms to create an efficient data entry experience for users. You learned that forms are the main UI in which app users can interact with the records that are being stored in underlying tables. Additionally, you learned that views are the primary forms in which app users can review records that are being stored in tables. Both components are fundamental to a model-driven app. In the next module, all components will be put together into a single model-driven app.
