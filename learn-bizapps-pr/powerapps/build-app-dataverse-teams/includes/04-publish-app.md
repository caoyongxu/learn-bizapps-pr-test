Now that you have built an app, you will want to share it will your team. You do this by publishing the app to Teams. Once published, it will be accessible for your team to start taking advantage of it.

1. Open your app for editing in Power Apps Studio

1. Select **Publish to Teams** from the toolbar, then select **Next**

1. Select **Save and close**

By default, your Dataverse for Teams app is only available to the Team that you created the app in. Sometimes you will want to share your application with others in your organization. To share your app with others outside the Team:

1. Verify you are a Team Owner where the app is currently published

1. Open the **Build** tab in the Power App for Teams app and select **See all**

1. Select **Share with colleagues**

1. Type in the Microsoft 365 group or Azure AD security group to share with and **Enter or select a security group**

1. Turn on or off sharing of apps to the users then select **Save**

Afterward, the app will appear in the **Built by your colleagues** when they select **Apps** in Teams. To learn more about publishing your apps, see the links in the Summary unit at the end of this module.
