Microsoft created a few sample apps that can be used as-is or customized to suit your specific business needs. You can find these apps when you first open the Power Apps app in Teams.

Each app has unique requirements and uses various O365 services. The install process may be slightly different depending on what is needed. To install any of these apps, left-click on it and then select **Add to a team**.

## Employee ideas app

Collect ideas from your team and then review, manage, and vote on them to see which ones are worth exploring. Use campaigns to organize the team's ideas. The app posts each idea to a Team channel as they are submitted.

## Inspection app

The Inspection app manages, schedules, and collects reports from your team. From there, you can analyze the results. It uses Microsoft Planner to track the inspections. Two apps get installed, "Manage inspections" and "Inspections."

"Manage inspections" allows you to edit settings and define the type of inspections your team can make. It also gives you an overview of everything completed and provides reporting.

Each team member uses the Inspections app to view and update inspections assigned to them. They can start an inspection, review status, and track their own progress.
