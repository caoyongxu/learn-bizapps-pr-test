  questions: 
  - content: What is the primary purpose of the hero template?
    choices: 
    - content: To help make it easier for you to have an app that allows you to list, create, edit, and delete records
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: After you have defined your data source, the hero template will provide the needed components for a basic app. The hero template simplifies the process of having the necessary components so that your app can list, create, edit, and delete records.
    - content: To give you a layout that is dynamic and compelling for the user
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The hero template provides a simple way to build a basic app, and it’s up to you to change the app to better meet your user and organizational needs.
    - content: To go through the app-building process
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The hero template provides a simple way to build a basic app; it does not lead the user through a step-by-step process.
  - content: What triggers Power Apps to automatically save every two minutes?
    choices: 
    - content: Creating a new app
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Creating a new app does not start the process of automatically saving every two minutes
    - content: Selecting the Save button in the toolbar
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: It’s a good idea to select the Save button after your data has been loaded into the hero template for the first time.  Only after you have selected the Save button will Power Apps start automatically saving changes every two minutes.

      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Previewing the app does not start the process of automatically saving every two minutes
