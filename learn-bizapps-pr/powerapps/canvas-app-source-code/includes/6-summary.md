In thisâ€¯module, we explored how you can unpack a canvas app from a single monolithic file to many files each describing individual part of the app. In these files, formulas from your app are represented in YAML text format to allow easy reading and editing. The YAML format also makes easy to compare the multiple versions of the same file and identify the differences. The unpacked files can be stored in source control to enable change tracking. After packing the individual files back to a single .msapp file, the app can be uploaded to update the cloud version of the app.
