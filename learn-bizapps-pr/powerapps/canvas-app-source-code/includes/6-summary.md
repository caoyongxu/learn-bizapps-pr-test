Thisâ€¯module explored how you can unpack a canvas app from a single monolithic file to many files, each describing an individual part of the app. In these files, formulas from your app are represented in YAML text format to allow for efficient reading and editing. The YAML format also helps simplify the tasks of comparing the multiple versions of the same file and identifying the differences. You can store the unpacked files in source control to enable change tracking. After packing the individual files back to a single msapp file, you can upload the app to update its cloud version.
