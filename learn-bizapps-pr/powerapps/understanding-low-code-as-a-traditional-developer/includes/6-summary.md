Congratulations on using Power Fx to create your first Power Apps app!

Although Power Apps is a low code development environment, a lot of the concepts you already know from traditional software development apply.

Power Apps lets you quickly create, iterate, and deploy applications that run on the web and on mobile devices. Power Fx lets you create apps in Power Apps quickly and succintly, only requiring the code you need to get the job done.

Let's review what you've learned:

- When we talk about low code development we mean a small amount of code to get results that would normally take several more lines of code in a traditional programming language.
- Microsoft Power Fx is the low code language for expressing logic inside of canvas-based Power Apps.
- You created a canvas-based Power Apps application using Power Apps Studio.
