Congratulations on using Power Fx to create your first Power Apps app!

Although Power Apps is a low code development environment, many of the concepts you already know from traditional software development apply.

Power Apps lets you create, iterate, and publish apps that run on the web and on tablets and phones. Power Fx lets you create apps in Power Apps quickly and succinctly, only needing the code you need to get the job done.

Let's review what you've learned:

- When we talk about low code development, we mean a small amount of code to get results that would normally take several more lines of code in a traditional programming language.
- Microsoft Power Fx is the low code language for defining logic in canvas-based Power Apps.
- You created a canvas-based Power Apps application using Power Apps Studio.
