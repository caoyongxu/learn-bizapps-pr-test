In this module, you discovered non-tabular ways to bring data and functionality into your app. Action-based data sources can be used to read and write data but also to perform additional functionality like sending notifications or triggering other actions. You also learned how Flow, which you already have a license for if you have a PowerApps license, can be incorporated into your app to increase the functionality. With its support for approvals, complex business logic, and working with complex data, Flow is the perfect companion to PowerApps. These items are important to remember:

-   PowerApps supports both tabular and action-based data sources.

-   With action-based data sources, you can use the data sources
    provided functions to interact with the data source.

-   You can easily connect PowerApps to Flow, providing your app with
    additional capabilities. With this connection, you can pass data
    back and forth between the two platforms.
