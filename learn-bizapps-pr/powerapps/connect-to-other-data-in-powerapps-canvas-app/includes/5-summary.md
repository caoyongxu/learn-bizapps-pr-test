In this module, you discovered non-tabular ways to bring data and functionality into your app. Action-based data sources can be used to read and write data but also to do other functions like sending notifications or triggering other actions. You also learned how you can incorporate Power Automate, which you already have a license for if you have a Power Apps license, into your app to increase the functionality. With its support for approvals, complex business logic, and working with complex data, Power Automate is the perfect companion to Power Apps. These items are important to remember:

- Power Apps supports both tabular and action-based data sources.

- With action-based data sources, you can use the data sources
    provided functions to interact with the data source.

- You can easily connect Power Apps to Power Automate, providing your app with
    extra capabilities. With this connection, you can pass data
    back and forth between the two platforms.
