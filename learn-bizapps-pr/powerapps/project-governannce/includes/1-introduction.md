# Introduction to project governance

A Power Platform Solution Architect plays a key role on a project. The solution architect will end up implementing governance, change processes and monitoring the project progress.

## How can the solution architect help?

The solution architect specifically can make sure that requirements are in scope and nothing is over-promised. The Solution Architect therefore will need to  manage the project's scope and keep the project on track. This sounds easy but in practice, requires the solution architect to be proactive in managing the project even when there is a project manager involved.

Most projects fail it due to the technical capabilities of team member's but in failing to manage the scope of the project or in not addressing issues as they arise.

During the project the solution architect is a key member of a governance team. As scope or requirements change they are typically involved in review and impact assessment and are on the front lines for allowing scope creep to happen and to prevent it from happening. The solution architect may not have a seat at the governance table, but their impact will always be there.

The solution architect can help project governance by:

- Being a key member of the governance team.
- Helping manage changes in scope and requirements.
- Looking out for issues in the requirements including regulatory, compliance, auditing, and security.
- Not over-promising and helping to encourage small steps towards a big goal.

The solution architect will be seen by other project members as the technical leader of a project. The other team members will look the to the Solution Architect as to how they handle changes in scope and how they should perform their own duties in relation to governance of the project.

## Keeping a project on track

Consider the projects you have had experience of as a project team member and answer these questions:

- Did the project have a governance process?
- If there was a governance process, was it followed?
- Were risks documented and were risks mitigated?
- Was there a change control process?
- How effective were these processes and could they have been improved?

These are all issues that the solution architect may have to address. Before, we get into this we need to define what we mean by project governance.
