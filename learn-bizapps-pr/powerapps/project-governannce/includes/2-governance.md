# Project governance

Project governance is not project management although there is some overlap. Project governance is the framework within which decisions about the project are made.
Project governance is a critical element of project and if performed badly, or not at all, will lead to the project's failure.

> It is better to have any project governance process that none at all!

## What do we mean by governance in a project

Projects are not fixed. During a project, challenges will arise that will need to be dealt with. If ignored, then what can be a small question can turn into a major problem. If a project focuses too much on things as they happen the project can fail to move forwards. Having a project governance process in place assists a project handle concerns raised.

Project governance is about primarily about decision making within the project:

- Authority: Who makes the decision? Do they have the experience and expertise to make the right decision?
- Process: How are decisions made? How do you balance impact analysis against the need for timely decisions?
- Evidence: What information is required to make a decision? How do you perform analysis of the impact?

Any governance process should be inline with contractual terms for changes agreed to by customer. Ideally, in the Statement of work for a project, the decision making process should be defined with the ultimate authority named.

Often, your customer, whether that is internal or external, will have their own governance process but this process may have gaps or may not be relevant to the Power Platform. Projects implemented using the Power Platform can be very different to projects that customers have experienced before and the existing  governance process may not be relevant e.g., in the speed of decision making or the level of  information required. The solution architect needs to ensure the governance process meets the needs of a Power Platform project. A solution architect will either need to adopt the existing process or build a hybrid process.

> If no process is in place, the Solution Architect should push for the creation of a governance process or create one themselves.

## Governance processes

At a minimum a project should assess:

- Risks: Documentation of risks, evaluation of risks, and risk mitigation implemented.
- Issues: Documentation of issues, and a process for evaluation of issues.
- Changes: Documentation of changes, and a formal change control process.

> [!NOTE]
> This module does not cover how to implement a governance process, but is concerned with making the solution architect aware that they must ensure there is a governance process in place for the project that meets the needs of the project.

## What was your experience of project governance

Consider the projects you have had experience of as a project team member and answer these questions:

- How were issues logged?
- Who was allowed to raise an issue?
- Were issues evaluated?
- Who performed the evaluation?
- How were changes raised?
- Were these process at the appropriate level for your project?
- How could you have improved them?

Let us look further into the solution architect's role in project governance.
