# Techniques for keeping a project on track

The solution architect should ensure that the project is always moving forwards towards the project's goals. The solution architect should establish good practices that ensure the customer and team members know where the project is and are aware of any issues that affect the project's progress.

## Recipes for failure

Here are some common areas of failure in a project:

- Not documenting assumptions
- Not doing risk management
- Excessive analysis and impact assessment
- Over-promising
- Designing with incorrect assumptions or requirements
- Organizational politics
- Not having buy in from senior management
- Not being able to have a complete enterprise vision

<sup>^</sup> This list is not exhaustive and many other things can can cause project failure.

## Recipes for success

Good projects have the following characteristics:

- Knowing what done looks like - from the customer’s perspective not yours.
- Having a change control board to manage change.
- Manage risk proactively.
- Being more agile.
- Performing Project checkpoints – How are we doing?
- Having retrospectives and evaluating lessons learned - How did we do?

<sup>^</sup> This list is not exhaustive and many more things that go into making a project successful.

## Project checkpoints

The solution architect should insist on a way to measure how things are going on the project. The solution architect should implement regular progress reporting and have checkpoints (tollgates) at critical points in the project.

For example, the solution architect can use simple Red, Yellow, Green coding.

This screenshot highlights the Red, Yellow, Green concept.  It provides a quick glance visual health of the project and what shape the areas are in. Good teams raise issues early, mitigate the issue, and escalate to red without last minute surprises.

This exact method doesn’t have to be used, but the solution architect should agree on a simple health check process.

## Retrospectives

The solution architect should evaluate how the project performed at regular points in the project. There is little point waiting to the end of the project to review how the project went as that does not allow the team members to put things right. It is important to gain an understanding of how does the customer think you did so you can address any concerns the customer might have.

The solution architect should establish checkpoints to look back at progress. Before the checkpoint, rhe solution architect should gather feedback from inside and outside the project team.

During the checkpoint meeting,the solution architect should push for no fault discussions. The aim is to turn failures into goals for the next checkpoint review.

Let us now look further at how the solution architect works as part of a team.
