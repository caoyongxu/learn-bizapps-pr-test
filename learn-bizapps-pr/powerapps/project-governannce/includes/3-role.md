The solution architect will often have the role in the project of evaluating issues and changes due to their experience and expertise. However, change is easy especially in Power Platform and the solution architect can become focused on change rather than ensuring the project is moving forwards. The solution architect should be looking to other project team members to perform evaluation and analysis of issues and changes, under the guidance of the solution architect.

One of the challenges faced by a solution architect new to the role is the process of moving away from doing  into leading and guiding. A solution architect needs to be available to other project tea members and to support their growth.

## Involvement in defining governance

An issue with Power Platform projects is that change is easy but lots of small changes and a poor governance process can kill a project. For instance, the solution architect needs to make sure the processes to evaluate change do not take longer than implementing the change itself.

It is imperative that the solution architect is involved in defining the processes and procedures for governance of the project so that they are appropriate the to the Power Platform technologies used and do not cause unnecessary overhead.

## Providing actionable feedback

The solution architect often sits between the customer and team members. The solution architect needs to provide feedback to both parties. Primarily feedback should be provided to help shape the solution.

Feedback can happen as early as the Request for Proposal (RFP)/Statement of Work (SOW) creation. However, feedback should be performed on an ongoing basis throughout the project.

The solution architect is responsible for keeping feedback constructive and actionable.

## Handling bad news

Sometimes, the solution architect provides feedback about something that may not be well received. Bad news does not get better with time. The solution architect must speak up early and share bad news.

Below are some examples of bad news that should not be held back by the solution architect:

- The cost of user licenses will increase by 87% if we move ahead with that requirement as written.
- That feature is being deprecated.
- With the added relationship, the data import will now take 30 days.
- Data migration has identified 200 new fields and from this data three new undocumented processes have been discovered.

The solution architect needs to keep feedback, especially bad news, actionable. There is little point in saying "Something is amiss here"; there is no clear call to action and the recipient is left trying to figure out what the problem is. Instead, the solution architect should make a clear problem statement and provide references and the potential impact on the project.

Consider projects that you have been involved in: how was bad news handled and what effect did it have on the project?

## Helping them reach the same conclusion

Appealing to authority does not work. Although the solution architect may have the most experience and expertise, you need to help the project team members and customer along the journey to the resolution to an issue. Simply saying "That wonâ€™t work" is likely to put someone on the defensive. The solution architect should always be constructive and avoid saying "No" too often; offer options instead or negotiate the requirements.

You should ask leading questions such as "Will that cause 1,000,000 Power Automate cloud flows to be run with that configuration?" to encourage them to think about the impact of what they are proposing. Remember, the person may not have the overall view of the project that the solution architect has.

If you have concerns about a proposed solution or a change, you need to highlights your concern but encourages them to think through and resolve the concern.

Reviewing the work of others is a key task for the solution architect. There is a fine line between reviewing what someone has done and do the work yourself. When reviewing the work of others, the solution architect needs again to be constructive. The solution architect should provide suggestions on where to look for answers. For example, when it is not clear that a solid design is proposed, the solution architect might encourage the creation of a Proof of Concept (PoC) or other tests to validate the proposed solution.

The essence of the role of a solution architect is to constantly talk to the people involved in the project to ensure that the vision of the project is achieved. Poor solution architects hide away from the team and spend their time updating their architecture designs.

Let us now look at techniques a solution architect can use on a project.
