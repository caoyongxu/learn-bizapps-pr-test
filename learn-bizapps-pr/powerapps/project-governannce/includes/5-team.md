The solution architect will generally be the most experienced person on a project and may be the most skilled in many of the tasks in a project, but a solution architect cannot do everything alone. The solution architect needs to break down the work and allocate the work to the most appropriate team member.

The solution architect owns the overall vision of the technical solution for the project and needs to communicate that vision to the team. 

## Being a role model

The solution architect is visible in the project to other team members and will naturally be seen as a role model. The engagement manager and project manager lead the project, but often the solution architect is looked at as the "real" leader and can set the tone and pace for how the team works. The solution architect is therefore responsible for setting an example for others to follow on the project.

The solution architect may further be responsible for increasing the skills and experience of project team members, mentoring them, and encouraging them to take more responsibility and gain new skills.

## Assessing the teams skills

A solution architect establishes the breakdown that will be used for the functional and technical design. As a solution architect it is not often that you get to choose your team and not everyone on a team can be a rock star performer.

The solution architect must learn how to assess skills of team and their weaknesses so as best to assign tasks to team members. The solution architect does not ask for a resume to learn how much Power Platform they know, but they should have a set of probing "discussion" questions to test knowledge, for example,  when should they used Managed instead of Unmanaged solutions, or when should they use Business rules or Power Automate cloud flows.

The solution architect could also assign small tasks or Proof of Concepts to team members and assess results. The solution architect should encourage the team member to explain their proposed solution so you can understand their thought processes. You may actually learn something.

The solution architect could create a skills matrix as the project evolves to enable project to apply the strengths of the team to succeed.

## Staying on the same page

The solution architect often brings a lot prior knowledge and experience and is the person on the team who gets to see the "Big Picture". The solution architect should not assume that everyone else has the same skills, knowledge, experience, or understanding of the project.

Making assumptions and generalizations can be risky. A key role of the solution architect is to communicate the information to team members at the right time. Communication should be clear and relevant to each team member. Emails may not be enough and the solution architect should talk regularly with team members to make sure everyone is on the same page. Remember communication is two way and to listen to the team members.

## Breaking down the work

Dividing work to assign to team members is a task undertaken by the solution architect. The solution architect should look for logical divisions of functionality in the application, , Customer Service vs Customer Acquisition. The solution architect should look for horizontal solution features such as document Management or computer telephony integration (CTI).

## Establishing standards

Standards are important on any project for the team to follow. There are some things in the Power Platform that are harder to change later such as the schema prefix or table and column names.

The solution architect should define standards so that there is consistency for:

- Naming of components
- Column data types
- User Interface: The options for forms layouts, when to use multiple forms etc.
- Automation: When to use different automation options such as Power Automate cloud flows vs Classic workflow vs Business rules vs Client script
- Security: When to use roles, column security, hierarchical security etc.
- Development: for example early vs late bound, error handling etc.

The solution architect should make use of Microsoft documentation such as [model-driven apps best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/best-practices/?azure-portal=true), [app design best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/appendix-app-design-best-practices-checklist/?azure-portal=true) and [developer best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/best-practices-sdk/?azure-portal=true).

## Working environments

The solution architect is responsible for defining how configuration and development will take place. This will depend on many factors including the skills of the team, if the team is colocated or dispersed remotely.

The development environment topology needs to be determined and some type of testing environment(s) will be needed. Remember, the the Power Platform does not provide version-controlled tracking by default.
