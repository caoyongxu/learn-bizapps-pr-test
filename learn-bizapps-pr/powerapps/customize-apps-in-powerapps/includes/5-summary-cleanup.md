Letâ€™s do a quick review of what we covered in this module.

You learned how to customize an app by adding controls, images, and logic. You got a chance to:

- Change the layout of a gallery.
- Change the data that a control shows.
- Change the order in which fields appear.
- Change the control with which a user provides information.
- Format a number as a price, and coloring prices based on their values.

## Next steps
In the next module, you'll learn how to manage app versions, share apps, and manage environments.

See you in the next module!
