You can import data into your CDS for Apps database in bulk from Microsoft Excel or CSV files. There are two ways that you can import files into entities from Excel or CSV files.

## Import by creating and modifying a file template
Every entity has required fields that must exist in your input file. We recommend that you create a template. First, export data from the entity. Use the same file (modified with your data) to import data into the entity. Using a template saves time and effort. - Prepare the file template.
- Modify the file with your data.
- Copy data from your Excel or CSV file into the template that you just created.
- Import the file.
