In PowerApps, you can use a number of different controls, variables, and
other functions to fully customize the end user's navigation
experience.

-   Use the Navigate function to send the user to any screen
    in your app.

-   Create additional navigational functionality by utilizing If
    statements, variables, and timer controls.

-   Use the Back() function to send your
    end-users back to the screen that they previously navigated from.

By choosing to use a combination of different controls, properties, functions, and formulas you can develop and deploy an app that's both functionally sound and simple to use. It should also be noted, just because you can add navigation in many ways doesn't mean it's always the best to do so. Think about the end-user interacting with the app and keep it simple.
