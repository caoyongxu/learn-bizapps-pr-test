Congratulations on creating your first app with Power Apps!

In this module, you discovered what Power Apps can do for your business and the building blocks of creating your first app. You then created an app from data in a Microsoft Excel workbook.  

Additionally, you learned that:

- To create, share, and administer your apps, you will use make.powerapps.com, the Power Apps Studio, and the Power Apps Admin Center.
- The power of Power Apps comes from the ability to connect to related technologies in your business. Examples of these are Common Data Service, Power Automate, Microsoft SharePoint, and other data sources.
- You can create an app by using several different methods. Some of these methods include from a template, a data source (like Microsoft SharePoint), or a blank canvas.
