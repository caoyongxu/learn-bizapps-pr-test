Congratulations on building your first app! 

To review, so far you've learned how to:

- Build an app based on data in a Microsoft Excel workbook that's stored in Microsoft OneDrive for Business. You learned that Microsoft Power Apps can connect almost as easily to data sources that you're already using in the cloud (such as Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Azure, Google Drive, and Salesforce) or on-premises.
- Customize an app to make it your own by modifying the appearance and behavior and adding Excel-like functions.
- Share apps instantly with your co-workers across the web, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Set up environments so that you can separate a working environment from the one that you want to share with your team.

The best way to advance your skills is to run the samples, practice using the templates, and generate more apps from your own data.
