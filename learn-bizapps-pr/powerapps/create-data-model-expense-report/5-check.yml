  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: How often will Dataverse autosave when you are making changes to tables?
    choices: 
    - content: You will manually save once and then Dataverse will autosave every two minutes.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This process is the case for Microsoft Power Apps, not Dataverse.
    - content: In Dataverse settings, you need to set up autosaves and then you can choose how often you want it to autosave.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Dataverse doesn't have autosave functionality when you are making changes to tables.
    - content: Dataverse will autosave every five minutes.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Dataverse doesn't have autosave functionality when you are making changes to tables.
    - content: You need to manually save every time.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Though you need to select Done when you create a new column, your changes will not save until you select the Save Table button.
  - content: Which of the following is a reason for using Dataverse for this solution?
    choices: 
    - content: You can define relationships between existing columns in tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. To create a relationship between tables in Dataverse, you need to create a new column exclusively for that purpose.
    - content: Dataverse has the most delegable functions out of the potential data sources.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. While Dataverse does support several functions for delegation, other data sources, such as SQL, have more.
    - content: You can access system-created tables that pull in organizational information.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. You need to access the Users table in this solution.
    - content: Dataverse is the only free data source that you can access with Power Apps.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Theoretically, you could still store data in Excel or in SharePoint.
  - content: What is the difference between a one-to-many relationship and a many-to-one relationship?
    choices: 
    - content: No difference, it depends on the table that you are starting with.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. A one-to-many relationship for one table is a many-to-one relationship to the related table.
    - content: One-to-many relationships relate to multiple tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Both relationships relate one table to another.
    - content: Many-to-one relationships relate to multiple tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Both relationships relate one table to another.
    - content: Many-to-one relationships are only available in Dataverse.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Other data sources might not list many-to-one as an option, but it is the same as a one-to-many relationship.
