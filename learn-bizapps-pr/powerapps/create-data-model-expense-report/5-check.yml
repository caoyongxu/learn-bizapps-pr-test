  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: How often will Dataverse AutoSave when you are making changes to tables?
    choices: 
    - content: You have to manually save once and then it will AutoSave every two minutes.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. This is the case for Power Apps, not Dataverse.
    - content: You have to go to the Dataverse settings to set up autosaves and can tell it how often you want it to AutoSave.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Dataverse does not have AutoSave functionality when making changes to tables.
    - content: It will AutoSave every five minutes.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Dataverse does not have AutoSave functionality when making changes to tables.
    - content: You have to manually save every time.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Even though you have to select "Done" when you create a new column, your changes will not save until you select the "Save Table" button.
  - content: Which of the following is a reason we're using Dataverse for this solution?
    choices: 
    - content: You can define relationships between existing columns in tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. To create a relationship between tables in Dataverse, you have to create a new column exclusively for that purpose.
    - content: Dataverse has the most delegable functions out of our potential data sources.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. While Dataverse does support quite a few functions for delegation, other data sources, such as SQL, have more.
    - content: So that we can access system-created tables that pull in organizational information.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. We need to access the Users table in this solution.
    - content: Dataverse is the only free data source that we can access with Power Apps.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Our data could theoretically still be stored in Excel as our back end, or in SharePoint.
  - content: What is the difference between a one-to-many relationship and a many-to-one relationship?
    choices: 
    - content: There is no difference, it just depends on what table you are starting at.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. A one-to-many relationship for one table is a many-to-one relationship to the related table.
    - content: One-to-many relationships relate to multiple tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Both of these relationships relate one table to another.
    - content: Many-to-one relationships relate to multiple tables.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Both of these relationships relate one table to another.
    - content: Many-to-one relationships are only available in Dataverse.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Other data sources may not list many-to-one as an option, but it is the same as a one-to-many relationship.
