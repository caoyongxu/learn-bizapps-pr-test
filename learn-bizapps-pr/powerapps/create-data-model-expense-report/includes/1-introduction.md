In the Transform existing process to a canvas app module (link to module), we looked at how we would transfer an excel expense report to a canvas app solution, including a new data model. Just as a refresher, here is the data model we ended up with:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of a data model showing the relationship between the Users, Expense Report and Expense Report Details.](../media/1-expense-data-model.png)](../media/1-expense-data-model.png#lightbox)

You may remember that the notations above lines represent the type of relationships between tables with 1:1 denoting a one-to-one relationship, 1:N a one-to-many relationship, and M:N a many-to-many relationship. Breaking up the information into multiple tables allows for a more dynamic and flexible data model. We also chose Dataverse as a datasource for the canvas app solution. Among many other benefits, Dataverse offers two key advantages for our scenario. The first advantage is that we can define and exploit the relationships in our data model within Dataverse. In this way, we can be assured that the relationship will be maintained. The second advantage is the Common Data Model. The Common Data Model is a series of tables already defined and, in some cases, populated in Dataverse meant to represent the most common tables needed by businesses. It is likely that you will need some of the predefined tables of the Common Data Model in your business solutions. We won't explore all of those tables, but we will be utilizing the Users table, which we will cover in the next unit.
