In the Transform existing process to a canvas apps module, we discussed how to create a data model from an existing, outdated solution. This module was all about building that data model out. You should now be able to explore and edit predefined tables in Dataverse, create your own custom tables, and create and define columns and relationships inside of those tables. This will make your apps much more powerful and allow you to see relevant information easily.
